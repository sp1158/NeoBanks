When you register with Atom, we ask you to set up 3 methods of security. These are your passcode, faceID and voiceID. When you come to log into the app you can choose which method you'd like to use by tapping between the 3 circles at the bottom of the page. You will however be required to ""Step up"" security when you come to make a change such as an interest preference or giving us your maturity instructions - for example if you choose to log in with your passcode initially then you will need to step up with your faceID or voiceID. When you open an account with Atom, you will be supplied with a sort code and account number. The sort code is generic to Atom however your account number is your own, relating to that specific account. If you choose to open a new account, you'll then receive a new account number. You can find your account details by popping into the app and tapping on the bubble that displays your account.I'm sorry that you found the agent you spoke to didn't answer your query clearly, I can certainly feed this back.

We do support most Android and Apple devices, but with the myriad of Android manufacturers out there, we can't support all the devices. As new devices become available, we have to be up to date in order to support them, as newer devices run on newer software, which can make older devices obsolete.  With us being an app-only bank, we have no plans to move to being online.  This means that we can continue to offer the rates we do.

However, with some applicants, we are unable to obtain enough information on them in order to verify them. In your sons instance, this may be due to him having a thin credit file, as advised when you chatted in to us. If this is the case, we'd be unable to offer your son an account at this time. We aren't discriminating against the youth of today, Lisa, as the reason your son isn't able to save with us isn't down to his age, rather than a lack of information needed to verify him. This can sometimes be the case regardless of age. I hope this has helped you understand the situation, but if your son would still like to save with us, he can always try again in the future should his circumstances change.Once again, thank you for taking the time to leave this feedback here.

Currently biometrics are linked to a profile and is the reason we would require you to reset all your biometrics rather than just your face ID.
