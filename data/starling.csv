This rating is for customer service NOT for the banking experience per se.I actually have 2 Starling accounts, both of which were switches over from RBS as part of the Business Banking Switch programme.  The first switch went through effortlessly and to be fair so did the second.Having received my switch incentive payment for the first account within the described 7 days, I had expected the same with the second one.  Unfortunately, this is where Starling and in particular customer support, have let me down.Despite spending the best part of 2 weeks either sending messages or trying to hold a conversation with someone in support via the chat app, the latest I have is that someone will ""chase this for me"".Having tried to follow up my last communication of 2 days ago, I now feel that my messages are being ignored!If this is the experience eveyone is having then, as from the article in the Financial Times on the 3rd Nov, its is no surprise that ""RBS struggles to meet deadline to offload 120000 customers""!","Hi David,Thanks for your feedback and we're sorry to hear about the delay in paying your switching incentive. These payments are managed and paid by RBS and although we do chase up payments on behalf of customers, it's disappointing to hear you haven't received yours yet.

It appears on my records as £0 credit limit, the impact on my rating probably is not effected my score but still think this is wrong. NO OTHER bank has done this. Would of been 5 stars But because of this it would of been 2 stars, however decided 4 stars because new customers will probably have a much better experience knowing the above.","Hi Andrea,Thanks for your feedback. This doesn't sound right. We only conduct a soft credit check when you open an account, and if you are accepted for a credit lending limit such as overdraft or loan, that's when a hard search comes into play.

It took multiple phonecalls and speaking to several different people before I got to the bottom of the issue. Very stressful and an unnecessary waste of time. I decided to complain about how badly the issue was dealt with. Starling offered to call me to discuss the issue and this would have been great, but they only offered times between 11am-4pm. I work full time and so the times were inconvenient. I asked if Starling could call me after work or at weekends and instead got a message to say they had made a decision on my complaint without even discussing it with me. Even though they offered to discuss it with me before making a decision. To make matters worse, they completely missed the point of my complaint and despite multiple paragraphs, only half a sentence addressed the issue. I rang Starling to ask if I could speak to the complaints department about the issue. But nothing is simple with: I couldn't be put through to the complaints department at that time (a weekday afternoon) and instead had to arrange another time to speak about it. Eventually I did speak to them, but only to receive a message to say, ""they do not feel any compensation was due."" What a waste of time! Have decided to leave Starling and just want to warn everyone that Starling is great when everything is fine, but don't expect much when things go wrong. Keep Clear.","Hi Shrita, thank you for taking the time to leave your review.We're sorry to hear of your experience, and that you had to chase our team to get a resolution.

If you need to have a fancy app showing your spending and makes it clear for you on how to manage your money then go for it.

I purchased something time a ago of £300 but then I cancelled and I The payment got reversed. The refund never reached my account and when I contacted starling they thought I was working in a customer service as they said they don’t know where the refund is and the ask me to contact the merchant and ask them for an ARN number to locate the funds. So I had to contact the merchant who had to ask his bank and then forward me that number so I could then forward it to Starling. So I had to do their job for them. I wrote an email with the number and I though finally I will be getting my refund sometime soon.

I love the fact there is no need for a standalone card reader for adding payees. The app is slick and efficient, and unlike those of some of the legacy banks is not a crime against UX practices. I love being able to have a Euro account concurrently. Fee free cash withdrawals overseas is a great perk. Excited to see how they continue to develop the app - hoping for some smart features that project balances forward given they know what payments are scheduled and can estimate recurring direct debits etc.","Hi Slim, Thank you for taking the time to leave your review.We're sorry to hear you had an issue with a transaction.

It's been 3 weeks since I started the process and nothing has been done (though 1 of those weeks is on me). By that I mean the account isn't open, it takes customer service 1-2 business days to answer a simple question, asking for documents that have no relevance like a Home Office Letter when they already have my visa and passport. I used the chat system online because obviously can't log into the app without having an account and as it turns out, they have ignored my application despite my having sent 3 emails to them in that same time span, one of which clearly queried how long will it take to resolve the problem. And now the individual I'm speaking to on the chat system - Will - has said and I quote 'Yes email does work, it maybe because you didn't send these from the email registered to your account?', as though he does not have my application in front of him which would clearly show where all my communication has come from.

For that reason I’ve stopped using it e turkey for now. I’ve failed to set up a pin yet so every time it declines, apart from being embarrassing, I can’t use the card by pin so I just revert to my Barclays debit card instead. Easy how habits start. I’ve almost stopped thinking about starling now! Need to fix the bloody pin and then maybe will give it another go.No foreign transactions on bank holiday is also crazy. You gotta fix that,","Hi Sarah, Thank you for your review.We're sorry to hear you've been having an issue with declined payments. The new rules have been applied across the banking world to help with security. Once your total spend on contactless reaches £135 you would then have to use chip/pin to reset it. You can also add your card to a mobile wallet and there is no limit on the number of times you can use contactless to make payment.When you opened  up the account you should have been asked to set up a pin, you can ask for a pin reminder directly with the app from the card section. You can use your card abroad any day you are away this would include weekends/bank holidays.If you need any further help don't hesitate to get in touch with our customer service team - https://www.starlingbank.com/contact/Team Starling",691

I deleted the message immediately as it sounded dodgy. I contacted Starling as I wanted to close my account and open a new one as I wasn’t happy to have money in an account in which my details may be known. People these days have all sorts of ways of getting you! The first advisor said ‘all they can do is set up a direct debit which you can then cancel in the app’. Well I’m sorry but you expect me to have wages in my account and live in fear that someone may set up a direct debit from my account? That just didn’t sit right with me. This got investigated further, the outcome of which there have been no fraudulent transactions on me account and my account was in good order. Great! However as a customer, I am still not completely satisfied about the text I received. So all I wanted was to close my account and open a new one then I can continue enjoying Starling. Unfortunately I can’t open a new account within 12 months from the date of closure. They said they are really tight on that rule even around the circumstances that led me to want to close my initial account. It’s not as if I’m leaving then changing my mind in a few months.I don’t feel valued as a customer or that they are putting my worries about potential fraud first.  Whilst you say you take fraud very seriously, I feel you could have done more to alleviate my concerns about my account details being known. I don’t want the fraud to happen before you do something about it which is the message that seems to be coming across.All I wanted was a new account and I feel that Starling could have done more.","Hi Shaun, Thank you for your review.We're sorry to hear about your recent experience and we wanted to reassure you that we take customer security very seriously here at Starling and have a number of measures our teams have in place to investigate any concerns a customer may have.We're sorry to hear you've taken the decision to close your account and at this time we're not able to reopen or open a new account for you for 12 months.We do appreciate the feedback you've provided and will work with our customer service team to ensure we alleviate any concerns a customer may have regarding this type of issue.Team Starling",1845

I used thief chat function which worked and it was explained that this will be reversed within 14 days.  After 14 days and no reversal happening I tried to call.  I had to wait over 10 minutes on hold. The hold music was on a 30 second loop so I heard the same jingle 20 times.  The person was very polite and explained that it was actually 30 days the merchant had to collect the money not 14 so I had to wait (still short in my account). I then noticed that a payment to my credit card was pending and not taken (which means not in my available balance). I contacted the credit card company. They said it hadn’t been presented.  So I tried to contact Starling. With no luck on the phone I goto chat.  This was painful and frustrating. The person contradicted what the app said.  I can’t make the payment again because it is still out of my balance but they couldn’t correct it.

It really has changed my relationship with money. I used to be extremely disorganised so I love how Starling warns you of direct debits or scheduled payments coming out of your bank the day before. It is also very clean and easy to view the percentages of your spending in a month (helpful if you have struggled in the past to monitor spending). Everything is elegantly layed out to offer you the facts. I feel more in control than ever. From these features I developed a budgeting plan and use the saving pots (it seems you can set up unlimited number) in quite a unique way to save for long term expenses. For example, on the run up to Christmas, MOT etc I set up pots to promote my saving on payday! So every payday I split my salary into the pots and just leave what I need for direct debits in my main balance. Incredibly it does not show the value of the saving pots in your main balance which helps me psychologically not to spend! Out of site, out of mind. E.g. If I need to travel on the train, I go into the travel saving pot and withdraw it to my main balance. It helps me greatly to be mindful when spending. I have doubled my saving for a house since using its features - would easily recommend to everyone!! Never had any issues with the app on my android either :) happy money lives for all!

I had so many issues with Tide I ended up having to go to social media as the only way to get resolution.Step in Starling (with heavenly music playing in the back ground and an angelic aura shining from behind).So we wanted to open a Starling account a while ago after researching the market but at the time it was only single owner companies that were allowed. We made the fatal mistake of then opening with Tide. (The least said the better about this company). Anyway, jump forward to the start of August 2019 and we were able to open an account as their changed their multi-user sign-up process.Overall, I am happy with the Starling service BUT there's 2 things that Starling are lacking:1) Anne Boden's bank is at the very forefront FinTech and are positioning themselves as an accessible entity but the one thing I have found is that submitting suggestions has no clear process.As with any software house (and let’s face it Starling are this as importantly as a financial institution), they need a way of allowing mass interaction of clients to feedback in an open forum, the wish list for their applications/web portal.A cloud-based service such as UserVoice is the ideal hub where people like myself can put forward ideas and others can vote. It saves the cost of expensive focus groups and operates 24x7x365. (FYI I have no affiliation with UserVoice).I have put forward a few suggestions and have been informed they will be forwarded but let’s be honest, that could just be a line. I'm not for one second saying it is but it doesn't give real validation to me as a customer that wants to help in building an even better service for myself and others.2) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE allow business customers to make custom categories for transactions. Tide has had this from the very start and I really don't understand how it has not been implemented by now with Starling.The pre-set categories that Starling has created for transaction are fine for personal cash flow analysis but really are totally useless and just serve as a frustrating reminder for business purposes.Having to lump all transaction into very generic boxes is not a real business tool.  3) Allow goals to have direct debits or reoccurring payments to be set up directly. As Starling only allow you to have 1 bank account per company, you ring fence funds into goals. This is a great idea but it falls short of being able to exploit the full potential of the function it could be.We previously had additional accounts that served the same purpose as Starlings goals but you were able to transact directly with them to/from external sources so you were able to operate DD's and Standing Orders for bills on them. Starling falls short here.Overall, I have to say that I am a Starling convert and not only moved my other businesses over, but also my personal accounts. I will recommend Starling to anyone who asks and do believe they are doing great things in FinTech... but please get something like UserVoice up and running.",NA,3078

My plan was to have all my direct debits from my holiday home in Spain paid from the Starling account to avoid the need for a separate Spanish bank account and the associated costs of banking in Spain. I was assured before opening the account that this could be done without any problem but this turned out to be far from the truth! The first of my DD companies said that they could not debit from the Starling account, the second said they could but when the money was requested from the Starling account it did not transfer and Starling customer service said that they had never received any DD request. After many days trying to sort it out between the bank and the supplier (including a formal complaint to Starling), I gave up and didn’t try with any other DD’s because I needed to transfer all my DD’s or I’d still need a Spanish account. So I am very disappointed that I didn’t get what I was promised. I’m considering whether to keep the account although it is useful in transferring Euros to my account in Spain. Customer service dealing with the problem I had wasn’t great - I had to do all the phone calls to the supplier to try to sort it out. Good points are that the ap works well and you get instant spending updates",NA,1301

The app blends a simplistic and smart look with a high level of information availability perfectly. It’s clean to look at and you can easily delve further into what you need. I’ve been recommending Starling to as many people I can. I for one am a convert to online only banking and Starling is top of my list (I have used others, which are good, but not as good!)","Thanks so much for your kind words David! It makes us really proud to know that you decided to bank full-time with us.

I first created an account to take advantage of the fee-free cash withdrawals in the US. I am using Starling as a second current account for my day to day spending. The app is easy to use and it's great to see instant notifications of spending. Transactions are automatically categorised but can be changed if needed. Having different Spaces to put money aside for different goals or bills is also a really useful feature. There are a couple of aspects I would like to change. First is the lack of ability to customise categories which would help customers analyse spending more effectively. Second is the issue of receiving notifications of a changed or reversed transaction and not being able to see what's changed within the app. Overall I am enjoying using Starling and would recommend others to try it.","Hi Steve,Thanks for such comprehensive review, and for your suggestions.

I like the spaces feature where I can save for stuff also rounding my spends up to the nearest pound and saving it.  Considering my dinosaur status when it comes to banking I am really impressed.

Most recently they have passed off their lack of risk appetite as “Greater Security” and therefore making it harder for me, the customer, to spend and use my money. This is done in two ways I have found exceptionally frustrating and annoying. 1. The hard £300 withdrawal limit- especially a nuisance when transacting in countries where cash is still king or at the end of season in holiday resorts where companies are trying to maximise the cash in take. Being the police or the tax man is not the job of my bank but the way they control access to my funds makes it seem that way. Personally I would like to absorbs more of the risk where choices I make about limits are off set by my funds. Through utilisation of data they would see that I regularly use the app to track spend and even have all notifications firing on my watch to alert me to a spend. I live on my phone and would be happy to report any and all fraud that slips through their “sophisticated fraud detection algorithms” and carry some of the burden. False positive data is one part of the story, but if the customer goes on to purchase using a different card or bank all they have done is increase the level of frustration and dissatisfaction. 2. Chip and Pin after 5 contactless - again this best born out of data and knowledge of how fraud occurs but once again we are given the transparent line of “enhanced security” wink wink, again our risk levels want to see more. Yet Apple Pay, use as much and for however much you like. This goes to the things you have and things you know policy seen in almost every bank. If data doesn’t show fraud being done in this way such as “Shoulder Surfing” translations then my bank should be challenging regulation and legislation to make it easier for me to transact. However I see typical banking behaviour from the “new bank.”The foreign exchange thing is good, providing you find a atm that lets you simply withdraw without their exchange rate being imposed. You will run into issues of withdrawal limits.","Hi Ali,Thank you for your review and comments we'll be sure to pass those onto our feedback team.As for the daily withdrawal limit of £300(currency equivalent) from an ATM we're not able to change that as it is fixed for all of our customers at that rate. You can use your card online or with chip/pin which has a higher limit In regard to contactless payments this has recently changed and you will now only be asked when you have spent £135 on contactless.

I have just put my student loan to go straight into my starling bank as I was going to use it as a second account for Uni but I have since added my wages to go into it and I get a notifications as soon  as they do along with any outgoing payments.My partner used Monzo but we have just made a switch and waiting for that to happen to a new joint account with Starling as the features are amazing and the app layout is so easy and sleek. The modern feel really does make a change from the traditional layouts on apps from banks and even Monzo is quite basic layout compared the sleek and modern approach used by starling. I appreciate the whole point of mobile based banking is there are no branches but you can use post office for everything now and be able to put cash of up to £20,000 a year which I appreciate is a lot alongside the maximum of £1000 with Monzo within 6 months.You can tell that Starling cares for its customers and it starts with the attitude of the founder and CEO Anne Boden who is clearly a fun person and her personality really suits the brand and she appears in blogs and videos which you never see from a CEO, they usually keep it down low and watch the money come in rather than interact as such.","Hi Lewis,Thank you so much for your incredible review!

"745","Linda Thomas",NA,3,NA,2019-10-12,2019-10-13,FALSE,"Exchange rate not what I thought it would be","I have found what I consider to be a flaw with the Starling Card. When using it abroad recently, it shows the transaction details and the exchange rate used at the time but on return home, the exchange rate suddenly change to a lesser rate so I was charged more on the transaction! On querying this via on line chat, I was informed that the MasterCard exchange is dependant on when the merchant processes the transaction so the exchange rate may be different. What I can't understand is why I am shown a exchange rate figure at the time of my transaction but that could change when the merchant then process that transaction which could be several days later as I was told so I will then get a different exchange rate. This does not happen when I have used my credit card. Once a transaction is made, the exchange rate used at that time is set, as I presume, not for the exchange rate to change when the merchant supposedly processes the transaction a few days later. I have always believed that once a transaction is made, the rate used is then set even if the process is a day or so later. It is misleading as you believe you have spent a certain amount on a particular day only for it to change a couple of days later. Not sure if anyone else have had similar experiences.","Hi Linda, If you have recently used your card at a merchant which is based abroad, this will explain why you see a slight change in your balance.

I then had to wait for an SMS code to reinstate it. This never came through no matter how many times I tried. I phoned. I couldn't get the verification question right about what my last payment was so they would not speak to me. I could not access my account to find out what the last payment was because I could not access the app. They said there was no other way to access my account if I could not answer the question. LOOP, no way out.Eventually, after several desperate calls, I got to a manager who gave me a verification code to access the account on the newly installed app. I then needed to put my password in which did not work. The manager said she would send me a new password. I pointed out that I could not receive SMS messages from them and only them, strangely. So she said there was nothing she could do if I could not receive their SMS messages. LOOP I could not get out of.  I managed to answer sufficiently to close the account as there was no way to get access. If I hadn't managed to, then I was told there was no back up route to prove my identity for example my passport. I would have lost my money, ""I'm sorry I cannot help you further"", said the staff member. ""Can I raise a complaint?"" I asked.""No, because I cannot talk to you further without you answering the security questions correctly. I suggest you ring off, think carefully about your answers and phone back when you can answer.""I am gutted because I really wanted Starling to work- but I've lost confidence in their customer service systems.***Response to the Starling reply: I did keep my PIN safe and my password. This was not the issue.  The password did not work and I cannot receive SMS messages from Starling. I hit a brick wall with call centre staff. As advised by Starling staff, I contacted my ""carrier"" GiffGaff who said it was not their issue it was a problem with Starling Bank's Carrier. Stuck in another LOOP batted between the two companies. I am gutted that the only solution was to leave Starling Bank.","Hi Nick,We're really sorry you've had to go through that experience. We take security very seriously at Starling and we're sorry that you weren't able to receive the text message required to gain access back to your account.

From personal experience I would advise against using the card for pre-authorisation purposes eg. On hotel check-in. It takes a long time (several days) for the transaction to be reversed where you use the card on final checkout but where the invoice is less than the pre-authorisation amount. In cases where you have used another form of payment at checkout, the delay can be up to 30 days.","Hi Duncan,Thanks for your feedback.At the point at which a customer authorises a transaction, the funds have not physically left the customer’s account; they are pending.The transaction will be reflected on the customer’s on-screen balance – this the ""effective balance"".Merchants sometimes ""pre-authorise"" funds by submitting a low value authorisation. This transactions verifies that the card details are valid and the account has a balance. The amount is usually the same as the associated authorisation, but can be more or less for various reasons (common for pre-authorisations and foreign currency card transactions where the exchange rate changes between the time of authorisation and presentment).With this process, it can take up to 30 days to settle the transaction, but we always try to have it settled before.

I opened a Starling account before I travelled to take advantage of the services they advertised. I noticed that all my payments get stuck on pending and that after it’s cleared my account goes into overdraft automatically because they don’t take the exchange rate of the day you made the payment, rather when the payment is cleared. I’ve been trying to resolve this issue among others for over 4 days now and every time I get a different customer representative that replies with the same automatic message and there is no personalised customer service what so ever. On other times I see amounts being deducted and then refunded back randomly. I lost all trust with this bank and I’m trying to close my account with them. Unfortunately even that request is still pending and its been a few days and they still didn’t confirm the deletion of my account!! Dont trust your money with someone like them. I’m sticking to my previous online bank, Monzo.","Hi Sara,We're really sorry to hear about your experience and that you haven't had a response from our customer service team.

The Starling banking ""service"" team seem to struggle when something is not as it appears. The app / bank also has difficulties in showing you the ""settled"" status of foreign transactions. Just because the app tells you a transaction is settled and paid, don't be surprised if as long as three weeks later they decide to recode and reconvert such a transaction!This is what happened to me which led to £50 disappearing overnight. I then made the mistake of following up with the service team which was a frustrating and painful experience. And low and behold, led to even more money disappearing after they found a ""problem"" that they couldn't really describe satisfactorily. And the icing on the cake - because of such incompetence and my shifting money away from this bank, their reconversion continued and caused a negative balance for which they now want to charge me interest and fees for.All in all - I will likely use a travel credit card for now. This bank promises much and looks swish, but under the covers, in my opinion, lurks incompetence.....UPDATE: interesting how multiple emails sent previously go unanswered but a poor review gains an almost instantaneous response. In response to the response from Starling below, No your customer service team have not got in contact but I do see a £20 ex gratia payment has been made despite no such offer being made in the two weeks prior that I have been stressed and trying to work this problem out with you. Mind - £20 is a long way from the £100 which has mysteriously disappeared from my account and is a puny amount that allows you to Mark this review as “dealt with” without having to lose face. I do not see that you have answered the questions I raised or provided details that allow me to understand why you decided to remove monies from my account three weeks after payments had been settled.","Hi Mike,We're sorry to hear about this and we can see that our customer service manager has reached out to you directly in response to your message.

I had a contract with a online retailer and stopped the contract. However the retailer was still asking for the monthly payment. I contacted Starling and they said they would put a block on the card for this retailer. I then got a payment declined from this retailer ONLY because i didn’t have enough funds in the account or the payment would have gone. I contacted Staring numerous times to get this sorted and in the end they basically said that they couldn’t put a block on any payments and anyone who has your card details can carry on taking money. They did say they would write to the retailer and dispute the payment but that’s all they could do. Not a safe bank if you can’t control who takes payments. Very concerning!!!","Hi there,We're sorry to hear there was a miscommunication regarding a recurring card payment.

Somehow your traditional high street banks manage to make all that a right palaver.I like the way the app works and I like the way I can pay cash in at the post office.So, well done Starling for making me happy. There’s a few improvements I’d like to suggest though: I opened a joint account with my wife; easy to set up but would have liked to choose another colour for my card so I don’t have two the same in my wallet.When I tried to set up another joint account (which would have been awesome for my work as a project manager. My client would have been able to give me funds and see all the transactions I make on their behalf). As it is, I had to set up a business account and will need to regularly show statements for the client’s peace of mind.In summary of those two points I’d like to see more than one joint account possible and the ability to share control of a business account. I don’t know yet if I can have more than one business account but I’m going to need one in the next few weeks.The way transactions are listed in the app is much like any other bank but I’d like to see flexibility here so I can tag certain spends and maybe put them in a different folder or list them in another view.Overall the service is excellent and well thought out and I am so glad Starling was recommended to me.","Hi Timbo,Thanks for your good review and feedback on the app.We welcome opportunities to make the app more user friendly and your idea to change the colour of the joint account card is a good one.

Now have a joint account and using the Spaces feature to save up for ""goals"". The rounding up of transaction to the nearest pound then automatically adding to the Spaces is great feature.Would be great to add more filters when viewing spending. I would like to view spending between set dates not just by month. The ability to organise Space manually would be welcomed.Had an issue whilst on holiday where I attempted to withdraw cash from an atm, the atm had no banknotes but still deducted the withdrawal from my account. I contacted Starling via the app and was told that they would look into it and they will contact back. Gladly the money was put back into my account after a week. So I cannot fault the customer service from my personal experience. Overall Starling is a refreshing approach to banking.","Thanks so much for your review Marius. We agree that instant notifications, spaces and round-ups are all amazing ways to have more control of your money. Just to let you know, more customisability in Spaces and filtering spending insights are things we are looking into at the moment. We'll be sure to let everyone know before we release an exciting new feature. It's also really great to know that we could help with the ATM withdrawal error while you were abroad.

"1265","Andrew",NA,8,NA,2019-09-30,2019-10-01,FALSE,"Ok but not great","So I have been with Starling since February 2019 and switched everything over to it, a proper jump in! Like most I looked at the benefits of using such bank that wasn’t on the high street.The App was the main draw for me because it offered categorising spending and instant notification, as well as the Apple/Google Pay services.However...I have had several chances to chat with support via the App and most the time the information was not clear and lacked any ownership.Pro:- Instant notifications (seems more instant since last two months)- Apple/Google Pay- Almost instant setup- Payment categoriesCons:- Support need better communication skills- More transparent about card payment issuesReasons I am now thinking of leaving:1. I just don’t want to chat to support because of poor previous experiences.2. Instant notifications at the start was unreliable3. September 2019 alone my Starling card was declined 6 times in four different shops with money in the account.4. Although I don’t need it, I was never offered a loan or overdraft. Why.I also find unless you are on top of categories they are a little meaningless although the App does try to sort correctly most of the time.I wish all the other main banks adopt the App features and ease of opening an account but due to declined cards I have to switch away because it’s just frankly embarrassing at the shops. Competition is good but this isn’t something I can back just yet.I may return in the future but it’s time for change.","Hi Andrew, Thank you for taking the time to leave your review and comments.

"1266","Tom Runar Lauritzen",NA,3,NA,2019-09-30,2019-09-30,FALSE,"Good app but customer support VERY poor","Update: no news from Starling on the pending transactions stuck in limbo for weeks. As this is something a bank should be able to deal with quickly, I have further downgraded my rating to one star. No point in a fancy app if you cannot do banking.I was immediately impressed with Starling when i joined early this year. Registration was a doddle, transfers went quickly and the app was a pleasure to use. For day to day banking I felt nothing could beat it.When I set up my own company it was natural to look for a business account with Starling. However, that is when I discovered their dark side as their customer support really was not up to the task. As my company was brand new I did not have annual reports and account statements, their joining process then went off the rails and I had to resort to a high street bank to get an account.The next big disappointment came just recently when I had a few vendors reserve transactions against my account. As the purchases were cancelled, the actual reservations were just left pending against my account as is normal banking practice. Unfortunately for me Starling does not seem to be able to cancel these pending transactions and now I am left with 600 pound less in my account as the vendors can do nothing. I have been in contact with Starling several times, but they just point to the vendors and seem to be unaware of their own policy which is to cancel pending transactions on the 8th day.So if you want a modern bank that actually knows how to do banking, look elsewhere.","Hi Tom,We appreciate your feedback and we are working to improve the banking experience of new business owners, as they sometimes don’t have certain documents available. However, we do work with these businesses to find a solution.With regards to the pending transaction, we can see you've been in touch with our customer service team who are looking into this and they'll be back in touch soon.Thanks,Team Starling",1529

Easy access to money and management, great phone app features but the one thing they let's the company down is their customer service.

They appear to push contacting via chat within their app however it's not fine tuned and I found myself waiting for a sign I was connected, having to close and open the messaging again. Then in between doing all this you are talking to several advisors who don't always check the history of the conversation so you have to repeat yourself.

Its just a gimmick and I prefer to have the option to just see a list instead.Contactless was introducted to make life easier for you. Starling has decided to make life harder for you by limiting this to 5 transactions then you have to reset to chip & pin. It claims government regulations but why haven't other banks followed?Lastly atm they offer me no incentive to move from my bank. I use it as a travel card. I have packaged account with my current provider and I wouldn't move unless Starling introduces a similar style.So its great concept. Easy to use. App has its pros and cons.

As they had never even heard of starling and think the way they have treated me as a customer is disgusting!!! This is not the future of banking at all !! So many fake positive reviews here makes you question trust pilot itself !! Response to your reply It has nothing to do with protecting me or your customers you thought I was upto something when I wasn’t! you treated me like a criminal and said so in those words to my brothers bank !!

In order to speak to someone in the UK they use some sort of strange algorithm that determines how many times you’ve phoned before redirecting your phone calls to UK advisors. Where ever their offshore advisors are based, they are absolutely clueless, complete waste of time. You might as well keep requesting a callback and disconnecting the call until their algorithm kicks in and you speak to someone who isn’t reading from a script and actually speaks English. Was advised by the merchant that funds had been returned 4 days ago and on their end and on my account with them it showed as zero. According to Starling Bank, they don’t trust their customers unless they are able to provide evidence of this. And they won’t receive the evidence from any email address unless it’s the one registered to your account. They do however suggest you use any email address you can access at the time regardless of who’s it is as long as you can verify it and send the evidence from it so that they can receive the documents they want (Advice from their offshore advisors). From what I have learnt, to speak to a UK advisor you need to get through 2-3 offshore ones first before being transferred to UK advisors. Just shows this bank is the same as all other high street financial institutions, they aren’t what they advertise themselves to be. Don’t pay attention to their adverts.

I like technology but I wasn't totally convinced about putting all my money into a computer!But so far it's been pretty good.   It was sooooo simple to set up a business and personal account at the same time (about 5 minutes) compared to a traditional bank it was light years ahead.I ran my account playing for about 3 months and it all went ok.Finally took the plunge and set up a switch.   Was easy peasy.So far so good.

I have several utility suppliers....I would love to be able to separate all my different suppliers but under one heading (ie electric companies, etc).

It's embarrassing for my card to decline and it defeats the purpose of having contactless in the first place if I'm asked to use chip and pin on regular basis.","Hi Michael, Thanks for taking the time to leave your review and comments.Our new security measures regarding contactless payments is something that's been introduced across the whole banking industry. So everyone that uses contactless as a payment method will be affected.As an alternative you can add your card to Apple/Google pay to pay for items. Using this method doesn't count towards the limit on contactless payments.Team Starling.",429

It was a easy experience and quite ahead of the traditional high street banks. I only really used this card when overseas but grew to really like the UI on the app and decided to try and switch Starling to my main bank. Before doing this, I had misplaced my Starling card and so I had rang to get a replacement which needed to be sent to my new address. I was told if I send through an email with a picture of my ID they would update and send a new card. This was in May-June 2019. I chased weeks later, and got a generic robot reply asking for me to send my ID. Annoyed, I re-sent my ID. No reply. For weeks. again. I chased and got told to AGAIN re send my ID for proof of address. I complained at this point and re-worded the subject header 'FORMAL COMPLAINT' as I was trying to switch my bank accounts but could not due to (1) Starling's pathetic customer services and (2) due to a lack of being able to get through to anything but a robot (or robotic human). Here we are in September, still no new card, no replies to my complaints, no replies to my ID being sent multiple times.I then asked for the account to be closed down as I realised this was all a bit of a joke, with a view to moving over to Monzo instead. Still......... no reply, my account is still active and I cannot get through to anyone.It is a shame that is has to come to this - Starling don't bother with some fake reply on here as you have been publicly shamed. Just cancel my account and get in touch. Don't tell me to contact you as I have been trying for 4 months.Stay clear guys. Traditional high street banks are much safer option.","Hi Jessica.Thank you for taking the time to leave your review and comments.We're sorry to hear about the experience you've had with our customer service which has not been the high level of support we aim to provide to all of our customers.We're keen to resolve this issue for you and kindly request you email us with the reference number reviews-61574 to help@starlingbank.com and we'll investigate this further.Team Starling",1683

My concern is that although 75/80% of the reviews are positive (and of course, a positive review/reputation is important(especially if you’re a business and want to grow)), there is still a % of people that are different... (that choose to live an alternative way of doing things, outside the mainstream) and unless they change or feel as though they are having a good experience, they are going to reject and not give their vote of confidence (just look at Brexit, and how that devides  opinions?). My concern is unless you fit into a particular way of living, or thinking, or being, and don’t fit into a mold(a particular model of normality).. the system doesn’t cater for alternatives.As it’s not necessarily understanding or nurturing of difference.In my opinion it’s always about finding that point of balance... itt doesn’t matter whether you have left wing or right wing tendencies, you need Two wings to fly a plane... but it’s like anything, you have to experience things in order to understand things, not just theory.But what I find these days, as I am getting older, I try not to waste time(all we have in life is time.) by trying to understand the Motives behind the thingWhat are the motives behind actions or promises? Or good or bad reviews?Words are easy to say.... so I will wait and see before I jump in with both feet...I’ll probably flip a coin.systems are great for making life convenient and saving time, but what is it you want to do with your time?Differences are important and it’s the difference that allows us to challenge ourselves.

The reason for above decision firstly I order Starling card so I can use abroad for obvious reason no transaction fee, when I traveled outside UK in 2017 and attempted to use the card in a multiple bank ATM for cash withdrawal, I contacted the customer service and they advised they would like the ATMs details so they can get it sorted with Mastercard, I know this was not an issue with Mastercard as I used another Mastercard for cash withdrawal from the same ATMs, as I had that as backup  anyway this issue never got resolve, even had the same issue when traveled back again in 2018.Secondly, about month ago I transferred some money to Starling from another account but from there is appeared few quid missing, I contacted customer service immediately but I felt like I am speaking with a stone they have given the vaguest reason for the money to go missing, despite me explaining to them with logical scenario where and money cannot go missing, well I never got my money back.Thirdly, this was partly my fault but I was expecting some help from the bank, story goes I accidentally £50 online as I was intending to spend 50p, and the account went on to overdraft, so I contacted the customer service requesting if the can write off any over draft charges as I am getting the money back in 7 - 10 days as this was an accidental spending, again it felt like I am speaking with some heartless person who does not care about their customer, I have practically begged to the customer service assistance as I don't get paid till 25th and I will have very much financial difficulties if they decide to charge me, only response I had from them was ""There is nothing we can do about this"", the customer service assistance just left the chat conversation midway without even telling me that they are leaving the conversation. (in similar situation Barclays have helped and did not charge any overdraft fee few years ago), I will be closing my Starling account and will get my best friend and Family member to close their account soon.Everyone who is considering to get an account this useless bank, please do not remember you are not only choosing the bank also their customer service.","Sorry to hear you feel this way Suyeb.We can see that you had an issue with your card abroad previously and this was an acceptance issue as a colleague confirmed to you over in-app chat. This means the terminal had not updated to recognise our cards. When there was a discrepancy with your balance, a colleague clarified why you fell into a negative balance. This is also something you can view on your statement. Unfortunately, the £50 you accidentally spent instead of 50p is not something we can void as when you enter an overdraft, there will be some small charges that do apply as per the terms of the account. Our customer service team will always do their best to help where we can but in some scenarios there is only so much we can do.Sorry if you feel you need to leave us as a result but thanks for leaving your feedback.Team Starling.",2347
"1448","Chadwell",NA,3,NA,2019-09-13,2019-09-14,TRUE,"5 Stars to Starling","I love my Starling account. Initially I was skeptical but decided to get a card and try it. The card arrive very quickly and I was soon using it. At first I put only a limited amount of money in my account, but quickly realised that this is a proper bank with all the normal facilities, guarantees and controls. I have been using the account for about 3 or 4 months and can find no fault with it. In fact the reverse. There are no charges for having the account; I have just returned from the USA and used my card for free spending several thousands of pounds; the online customer support is really efficient; the online app (for the phone) is super responsive with me usually getting an alert of a payment before I receive the physical receipt from the store/ restaurant; the PDF statements are really clear; paying others with either Starling or external accounts is a breeze; lodging cheques is simple - pop it in an envelope and freepost it to Starling - when they receive it you are notified; and I think that the spaces (dont really like the name - what about ""pies, pots, savings, goals"", etc) are great for setting budgets or savings: but if would be good if it were possible to see all the transactions in and out of these ""spaces"" rather than only the balance. Finally, I feel that security is excellent. A few weeks after setting up my account, I forgot my password, I thought that the password would be reset in the normal way, with Starling sending me an email with a link that I could reset my self. But no. When I asked for a reset, I had to use my phone and use my bio information (face and voice). Then several hours later the account password was reset - I guess in the intervening time Starling checking my face and voice to determine whether the request was genuine. All in all a great experience to date. So now my traditional Bank account is redundant and it will be closed as I move completely to Starling. Definitely this is the future of Banking. Give it a go!","Hi Chadwell,Thanks for the support and for such comprehensive review. After this, what else is there really left to stay?

Customer services often don't give any real detail, just preprepared answers which is a shame.Stability has been a major problem recently, few major outages in a few months and they don't tend to proactively let you know (i.e. push message warning your card might to work). Had a situation where I was filling up my car and my card was down so had no way to pay. If they had informed me via a push message I wouldn't of filled up. I don't feel i should constantly check the status of my bank!  They aren't as good as competitions such as Monzo with publishing their roadmap and what features they are working on, this would make it seem more user focused and help steer the features to the users. Overall better than a traditional bank, prefer to Monzo who tend to be in constant beta, but lately I am thinking of getting rid, due to the downtime - which is a shame!","Hi there,Thanks for taking the time to review Starling.

I was a complete advocate for this bank, recommending it to friends and family until I was part of a very sophisticated rental scam (property viewed, persons ID viewed which matched land registry - turned out to be fake).Despite the fact the bank are signed up to the new automated push payment (APP) code that is supposed to protect people’s money in circumstances such as sophisticated rental scams, Starling bank refused to reimburse me my money. I then wrote a formal complaint asking them to explain why they would not reimburse me as according to the new APP code, banks should reimburse unless:- you ignored their warnings (they sent me no warning when setting up the payee or when sending the money)- you have been grossly negligent (I had not) - you have been dishonest (I had also not)  Their final response was down to the fact the money was not in the scammers account anymore and therefore they could not reimburse me, they never mentioned the APP code or answered my question on how they thought I was grossly negligent in this incident. Through this process their customer service was not empathetic and unhelpful the majority of the time. I have now raised this case with the Financial Ombudsman in some hope to get my money back but I really think it’s important that I write this review as whilst Starling look great with their app and ease of use, they do not protect your money. Fraud is happening more and more frequently and even when speaking to the Financial Ombudsman on the phone, they say these scams are becoming more sophisticated. In my opinion, bank with someone who will look after you and your money and steer clear of Starling.","Hi Emma,We're truly sorry we were not able to reimburse you but our investigation process is thorough and we will always take measures to protect our customers where we can.

I liked the look of the overdraft when it was advertised but none was given me when I joined and has been this way for months. No benefits, alot of banks offer good interest rates, or cashback on household bills, NatWest gives me about £8 a month back! But starling doesn't give much back at all. Have yet to use card abroad but have heard good things, overall, decent bank with a handy perks, I've got it as a secondary bank to watch my spending habits but that's all for now due to problems mentioned. Thanks Starling","Hi Giles,Thank you for your review. We're sorry we were not able to offer you an overdraft. Please get back in touch again in a few months and we can check your eligibility again.There is a UK-wide issue with pay at pump fraud and so, after consultation with industry bodies, we've had to implement restrictive anti-fraud measures to combat that.

They hide behind a generic statement of what they must do under their terms and conditions but a huge number of people have had this problem.Some would say they have to cover themselves against allegations of failing to implement AML policies strictly enough.

Starling, Monzo, Revolut, the lot of them. AVOID!!

Unfortunately with starling you can only speak to the person in charge over the messaging app, who will reply at will. (Days go by with no response).

I spoke with several advisers on the phone and none was able to tell me exactly what was going on.

Each time, I was told someone will get back to me. To this day, no one has. I recently tried uninstalling and re-installing the app again and got a message that my application hasn't been successful. They also would not tell me the reason why.

Each of the individual has to open their own account (e.g. Husband has to open a account and wife has to open her account) and then both have to open a joint account. So in total 3 accounts. So basically Starling says close your individual accounts with other banks and hand over all the money to Starling. After hearing from experiences where some accounts have been closed or money withheld for further checks scares the hell. So if you were to keep the existing accounts and open 3 more accounts with Starling then you might end up with 5 accounts. Digitisation is to ease customer journey and give the benefit of using mobile phone for everything and not put more stress on customer to manage 2 more accounts which probably are unnecessary. Starling doesnt even allow closing 2 individual accounts once joint account is open.Starling even doesnt allow to open an account for another 12 months if a customer closes the account.Goodness me..I do not think this is ease for customers of handling more than required accounts.","Hi there,We’re sorry to hear about your experience.As a regulated bank and responsible financial services company we must make certain checks to ensure the security and protection of our customers.So that we can look into this further for you, please send an email to help@starlingbank.com quoting reference Reviews-61526.

Only two things were slightly wrong: first, when they were sending out updated debit cards they asked me if I wanted to keep the same number, which I definitely did as it looked ‘prestigious’ and easy to remember, but when the new card arrived it had a new number so I had to update it everywhere. Perhaps the CS rep didn’t know this would happen, still would’ve been nice to keep the same number. It’s such a hassle to update card numbers everywhere.

Everything worked seamlessly, queries answered in 10 mins or less, not a single issue. Then a few days ago I received a text message asking me to check the Starling app. A message saying Starling are no longer able to offer me business banking facilities at this time and would be proceeding to close my account in 2 months time. No explanation, no response to messages, radio silence. As you can imagine a bank account is a pretty vital cog in a business so this has caused complete chaos. I’ve no confidence whatsoever in this organisation anymore, they’ve still no responded to a single message!I’ve now got to go through the process of moving everything back to a high street bank.I would not rely on this company for your business or personal finances. It’s frightening that they can cut off such a vital service and it becomes near impossible to get in touch with them.Other users seem to be experiencing similar, I wonder there’s some kind of large culling of business bank accounts.EDIT: The response makes no sense. I've not tried to open a new account. I've been through all the checks and using Starling for almost a year.

Much like other app based banks, a photo of official ID followed by a short 3 second video of yourself requesting an account. Then boom!! I use mine to manage money for my family lottery syndicate. An account all online that just manages itself with standing orders going in, and Lottery direct debit coming out - along with the occasional small win. I’ve not opened a Euro account, as I see the benefit when travelling etc. I’ve only awarded 3 starts as there’s a couple of things I’d like to see. 1) I’d like to be able to open another Personal Account - at the minute you can only open 1. Then have one bank card - much like the facility Curve (one card for all your cards) does. I would then consider bringing my main account over 2) The Euro account. Despite reading all the stuff with it - I still can’t work out the fees or what exchange rate it’ll use. I really don’t know if it’s a good deal - so until then, I probably won’t use it. Wanted it to be a ‘better than the high street’ exchange rate and then use it as a savings account for holidays. 3) Aesthetically I find the app dark and a bit clunky. Compare it to Monzo and it just seems a bit depressing.","Hi Garry,Thanks for getting in touch!

I’m looking to move my business account and personal account to them and it has been a real nightmare so far. I contacted starling through the app and the call took 10 minutes to pick up and then dropped both times. When I finally got through I asked them to change my address which that could not do over the phone an ask me to email them (which was strange and I was already authorise through the app) then I was told to send them proof of address and that it would take three days to complete. I then asked them to call me when they were finished and they said they could not. They then said I would need to recontact them after the change of address to organise the card reissue as they could not organise that at the time of the current conversation. Most of this could have been corrected easily if I had received and activated the card (unfortunately the card never arrived). I’m really interned I’m using the euros account with free transfers (before September) but am seriously now thinking “is Starling that different to all the other banks?”  N26 looks interesting for that.

I am sorry that I have not yet taken the plunge to switch my account, but I am using it more and more since it also sends round ups to MoneyBox for me, which again was extremely simple to set up - still struggling to connect my legacy bank though! Went on holiday with my young daughter, and was delighted at the exchange rate I got, the round ups to my savings, and no charges! Was highlighted when I had to use legacy bank as I was over the limit that day to transfer funds, 2.75%..... Will teach me to top up Starling and use it so much more!As to the announcement of the removal of debit card funding, I used this as it was so simple, select card and double click, therefore I was a little disappointed. However, as I was doing some financial house keeping I went into legacy bank app to sent up payment, and it was already in place, so really not an issue. As I do not pay for anything with Starling but I do for my legacy bank, if the function is there, use it or lose it! Obviously not enough of us did! I am a firm supporter of Starling and I may be sitting on the fence by not switching my account in total but the fact that I earn interest is becoming very attractive as I see no benefit for what I am charged by my legacy bank. In addition, Starling deals with my queries politely and professionally. I could not ask for more. My husband will be changing soon and applying for a business bank account as Tide has been a bit of a bumpy ride servicing his business account. In addition I have quietly convinced convinced tow others to join.Thank you.for a great service! PS I am older than your demographic  and so are my friends who I get to open accounts too!

Everything is so easy, the App makes things so simple. You get alerts to let you know what's coming in and going out making it almost impossible to go overdrawn, there is a fantastic way to save money without having to open a savings account and what's more, the customer service is s good, they get back to you really quickly and put your mind at rest. Switching bank accounts was all done by Starling, no fussing about ringing everyone up with new bank details, it was all done at the click of a button. This is banking made easy, the banking of the future!

The money was donated to a charity based in London (in a poetic way that's kind of sweet). I was confused by this, so I contacted the charity, as I did not donate this money. The charity were very nice and said they would look into this for me. Th charity came back to me saying that, that very same weekend, they had received an abnormal amount of donations, much more than usual and upon trying to thank these people via email (all Hotmail accounts), each and every email got bounced back, a sure sign something was not right.The charity assured me that any donations received in this manner would be given back, no questions asked and their finance director got in touch with Starling Bank to confirm that the £200 received via my account was indeed fraudulent and I should be given my £200 back. A week or so later, and with zero contact or resolution from Starling Bank, I got my money back. Happy days.All was fine and then on Friday 9th August I noticed two £100 sums taken from my account from a cash machine in Melton Mowbray. This was strange as I am currently in Spain and had been for two weeks.I contacted Sterling and explained that I am currently in Spain and to investigate how money has been taken once more from my account. I got the usual we don't really care, sloppy attitude, have you mistakenly forgot you withdrew the money blah blah..NO! As I keep telling you, I am in SPAIN and not in the UK!Sterling Bank then told me that the £200 that rightfully got returned to me was then contested, so they gave it back. Who contested the charge-back and who did it get returned to I asked? No reply.I therefore rang the charity and they informed me that at NO stage had they contested the charge-back and at no point had they received this money. So who contested it, it can only be the original fraudsters that stole it in the first place?No one at Starling Bank gives a damn. You have to constantly go over information you have already provided Starling Bank. Not one person has rang me to investigating this fraud, and no one is taking this seriously. I am the guilty party yet Starling Bank have decided to refund money to fraudsters that stole money from my account in the first place.You could not make this up if you tried.It appears that Starling Bank do not seem to have a system or team in place to investigate fraudulent activities, which in today's climate of increasing online fraud is scary.I have asked Starling Bank to ring the charity to get to the bottom of this, they have yet to do so. Your money is NOT safe if you bank with Starling Bank and they do not take fraud seriously enough to protect you, the customer.I am fuming that Starling Bank have not phoned me once or got any special team in to investigate this crime, and then they refunded £200 to the fraudsters direct!! How on earth in 2019 can that happen?My advice, DO NOT put your hard earned money into a Starling Bank account, it is clearly not safe there.I am now seeking legal advice.My advice: Avoid Starling Bank like the plague.","Hi Rob,We're really sorry to hear about your recent experience.We can see that our customer service team are looking into this further for you.

I was previously paid fortnightly with my employer and needed to separate my spending money from my mountain of direct debits to run a household. Being able to add funds easily and be able to keep my spending in check with notifications on the app both on my phone and on my Apple Watch has been; at the risk of sounding over dramatic, life changing. No longer am I wondering what is available and what is pending, no more am I confused as to how I've spent so much money as it's broken down by retailer, by category and I've been able to save even MORE by seeing such trends. Add in the fact that 'rounding up' purchases as well has also been a help it's been a solid win win.Brick and mortar banks are catching up to this trend albeit far too late, at a snails pace and not nearly to any great degree that Starling has (and continues to do)An addition is that when traveling to Spain on holiday in March I was able to put all my holiday funds in and not worry about fees or extortionate exchange rates as Starling had it all in the bag for me. I've sung their praises to friends and family alike and have even opened a joint bank account with my partner to share costs such as food shops - again, with extreme ease and simplicity of use. Couldn't big up this bank any more if I tried (and who even thought that this would be possible considering the reputation banks have!?) but I would implore anyone on the fence thinking to join - please do so. Despite returning to monthly salary with my employer I still make great use of my account and will continue to do so. Whether as your main bills account, a spending one or even for holidays, it's worth its weight in gold and then some.","Wow! We absolutely loved reading your review Ewan. It's amazing to hear the impact Starling has had and it fills us with pride.

I guess they are ok till everything goes smooth but when you need any customer service things go from bad to worse pretty quickly.Recently I withdrew some forex from Gatwick airport and was charged an incorrect amount by the ATM ( More on the ATM in a separate thread). I noticed the mistake when I checked my starling account later. I contacted Starling bank during my holiday and (chat support is the only way to contact)  was told that it was an ATM issue and that I had to take it with the ATM provider directly.Not unreasonable so far.  I asked for details of my transaction  - a transaction id and some detail about the atm  - but all the support person could tell me was that he could see that it was from a atm machine at Gatwick and thats all. He couldnt tell me who the ATM provider was.  He suggested that I should contact Gatwick airport for details of the ATM and then get in touch with the ATM provider as he had no further information.I tried to explain that it was difficult for me to recollect and since they had already settled the transaction they should have more specific information as to which ATM provider and some reference for transaction. Then i asked to speak to a supervisor. Again explained the situation over chat and got the same response. After nearly an hour of back and forth only when I asked them to lodge a formal complain that despite being a bank who had settled a transaction - 1. they could not give me more details of the ATM machine ( just some coded gibberish that I could see on the transaction as well)2. they could not give me more details of the transactionSuddenly the supervisor was able to give me a transaction id and details of the ATM ( It was moneycorp ATM - more on it separately). Apparently to 'help me' the supervisor had looked in another feed and found the information. I found it ridiculous that you have to chat for an hour with 2 support people to get this basic information.This entire conversation took place over chat over 1 hour during a holiday causing a lot of stress.I think they have very poor training on procedures etc. even supervisors couldnt immediately help. The chat only interface makes it a real pain. Further on going to their website to raise the issue on Starling community I realise that they have shut down their community forums.I have not given them 0 or 1 star becuase they are the only bank that provides daily forex cash withdrawal at mastercard rates but have begun to wonder if internet only banks like starling are worth the time and hassle.Regards","HI Sripada, Thank you for taking the time to leave your review and comments.We're sorry to hear about your experience when contacting our customer service team as it appears we didn't provide the high level of service we aim to provide to all of our customers.

Or an option on the 'Home' tab to choose a day and then see what you spent on that day. More stats at the end of the month would be useful to say how your spending this month compared to previous months, if you have spent more than usual or if there were certain days (or merchants) that you have spent a lot with compared to normal.It would also be great if you could create your own Categories, name them and pick from a selection of icons, this way I could really customise how I see the Categories spending breakdown",NA,986

The Euro rate (mastercard rate) was higher than my current pre paid holiday card so an added bonus plus I only needed the one card. My high street bank has closed our local branch as well meaning we were having to use a local post office. I started to use the card before my holiday and then for 10 days faultlessly in Cyprus. Everything’s in real time whether credit or debit and it allows notifications to your phone saying what’s come in or gone out as it happens.  It’s amazing and now my wife and business partner are both Starling Bank account holders too after showing them how easy it is to use. If your reading this and are unsure what to do then I say download the app, sign up and use as a separate account to start with till your used to it. You can then decide whether you wish to transfer everything to it. Once you see how easy it is and all the benefits I can assure you, you’ll be hooked.

And secondly I am still using my Monzo savings pots, which don’t give you interest - unlike a Starling current account - but can be locked until a certain date (ie Tax Deadlines)..

The app is a pleasure to use. Starling also works with freeagent which I've been using for over 5 years, so that was a big plus.Customer service is good too, fast response times for chat and with real humans on the other end! There are improvements to be made (notably, the spending categories on my business account are the same as for personal and pretty much useless from an accounting point of view) but I do most of that in freeagent so it hasn't hindered me too much. Overall, would definitely recommend.",NA,800
"2364","Baz Thexton-Carpenter","https://user-images.trustpilot.com/59676ed00000ff000aaee9e1/73x73.png",3,NA,2019-08-01,NA,TRUE,"Overall a Great bank! 👍🏻","So, Starling Bank, basically they have changed the way I manage money and all for the better, but it isn’t perfect and could do with a few tweaksFirst the downsides Paying in cheques is a bit of a ball ache as you have to post it to them, which delays things a little bit, although you can pay in cash at a Post Office you can’t pay in cheques which would make things a bit easier, on the flip side, you send the cheque in an envelope with a free post address so at least it doesn’t cost anything.  The one thing that is missing is a ‘pending’ so you can see the cheque is in the process of clearing, you get a message to say it’s been received then nothing until the funds appear in your account.Then there is the goals section of the app (which is a positive thing too, see below), you can add in money as and when you want to, and you can schedule payments into a certain goal too, but you can’t schedule withdrawals from the goal either, I personally would like to add my direct debit/standing orders and other bills into a goal that would then transfer into the main account the day before they are due, I appreciate that a goal is something to aim for but it would be a useful tool to have.In the payments section of the app they list all the payees in alphabetical order with a date due/last paid underneath, it would be much better if there was an option to sort it in date order, that would be easier to manage your payments and give a much quicker view on when the next payment is due, at the moment, you have to scroll through everyone and check the dates individually which (although not the end of the world), is a little time consuming.The last negative is the bank card doesn’t have the sort code on it, so when using your card to set a DD up, you have to open your app to get the details instead of just looking at your card.The customer services section is good, however there have been occasions when I’ve sent emails and not had a response and they have said they’ve not received them, and on other occasions I’ve been half way through sorting a problem when the responses suddenly stop, and then picked up again when I’ve chased, on the plus side they have always resolved an issue, you just get the feeling that if you were sat in a branch of a bank then you can sit in front of a person and know it will get sorted before you leave, with the online help from Starling you just have that feeling they can almost ignore you or respond when it suits.  Generally though the online help is good, but you can’t remove or delete conversations that are no longer validSo let’s look at the positivesThe app itself if fairly simple to use once you’ve got your head around what button does what, it’s fast and responsive too and has a nice ‘flow’ to it Sending one off payments to people (like when the kids need that bit of cash!) is instant, which is fantastic, once you click the pay button, by the time your payee has opened their banking app the money is there.The switch service is simple and I had no problems at all with any of my standing orders and direct debits, it was a lovely smooth transition.Goals section is a great idea, you can round your payments up, I’m currently saving for some EarPods 🎧 and in 3 months saved over £50, and you really don’t miss those extra pennies, how often do you say ‘it cost about 20 quid’ when it was actually £19.40? That 60p goes into your goal and soon mounts up!You can have multiple goals too so if your saving for something else you can ringfence the money and best of all, earn interest on it and have instant access if you need it.The account is fully functional with Apple Pay which I love more than anything.You can also see where your money is going each month, by category and by merchant, made me think more about what I’m spending on eating out!  It doesn’t always get it right with the category but it’s customisable and will remember the change.The instant notifications for spending is great, you may think why do I need to be told what I’ve literally just bought, but what if someone has stolen your card or details and you get a notification that you’ve spent something that you know you haven’t?  You can go straight into the app and lock the card so security seems very good.On the home screen you get a graphic showing what you’ve spent that day, so on one of those shopping days out if you have a budget you can keep track where you are at, which is really useful.So overall the positives outweigh the negatives and the bank is right up there with the best, with a few tweaks to make it more user friendly and sharpen up its customer services it could potentially be the best online bank, I’d highly recommend them especially if your trying to make your banking life easier, which it does in spades 😎👍🏻",NA,4782

When you go thru the various steps to open a business account it says “.....we can’t currently offer accounts to businesses that involve:  .....antiques,art,precious metal or stones dealing.It would avoid confusion if Starling Bank was clearer on their requirements in the text contained within the App as it contradicts what I have been told ie; I can can sell art.2.

The ease of opening an account is the most attractive aspect of the bank to new customers. The freedom to separate money into different accounts helps customers to save and invest in the important things in life.  The classification of every transaction and cost into different categories is unique.  It allows people to gain a deeper understanding of their spending habits. The instant transaction notification is a feature everyone wishes for from their high street banks, but they fail to display transactions as quick as starling.  Starling also awards interest on the balance in the account which is just a cherry on top of the cake. It is amazing to recognise banks and companies such as starling to fundamentally challenge the old/frustrating concept of a bank and convert it into something customers actually want and need. I believe the bank would continue to develop and provide excellent customer service with ease of use.  Something I believe that would really help enhance the value of the bank in the future would be inclusion of other services such as insurances,  rewards, ISA's for investment, credit/overdraft facilities and ability to merge many different bank/ credit accounts into one.","Hi Rushabh, It’s wonderful to hear that using Starling has made managing your finances easier.

But the one thing which went drastically wrong was when I sent £100 to a family member in the USA. I send money to this person regularly via Paypal, but I thought I'd try it on Starling, given the ad: ""What you see is what you get."" That turned out to be stupefyingly misleading. I opted for the fast-track option with the fee and my app told me that $118 dollars had been sent. But the US receiving bank credited my family member with only $83, a staggeringly low exchange rate! I got on the Starling chat help. It appears that not only had the receiving bank made a charge but the money had passed through some third parties each of whom had also added a charge, amounting in total to $35. I accept that Starling has no control once the money has been sent, but I think it should be made crystal clear -- not just in the fine-print caveat -- that what you see is not what you get. I have since reverted to Paypal which works transparently.","Hi Gabriel, Thank you for taking the time to leave your review and comments.

It's difficult to live without it at the moment. Even £1K would be good. - On transferring to Starling my 'Milk and more' direct debit was not carried over. No milk for a week. Yikes!","Hi Philip,We are sorry to hear about your direct debit not transferring over. Please get back in touch with our customer service team, if you are still having issues with your direct debits https://www.starlingbank.com/contact Quickbooks aren't ready to integrate with us just yet, but we currently have integrations for FreeAgent and Xero. We will be sure to post future updates. We don’t offer euro accounts for business, but we will let you know if this changes in future. With regards to an overdraft, if you reach out to our customer service team, they will be able to check your eligibility. We really appreciate your feedback, as we are always looking for ways to improve the customer experience.Team Starling",577

Should you require a PDF or CSV format file of transactions for your 'financial' representative, then they can be selected and sent via email to yourself for later forwarding.The App is rarely unavailable or 'down' and has proven to be very secure - accessed via my mobile phone scanned 'fingerprint'.I upgraded my phone before I transferred my account.The Starling Bank account comes with a DEBIT card for online and day to day cashless shopping.Cash and cheques are credited to your account via the 5* Post Office branch network.The SWITCH to Starling from my old high street bank was seamless - I even chose the final transfer date. Note that the Starling Bank account was available for my use before that date.So far, I have only transferred my business 'current account' over but, I will be moving my own 'current account' over to Starling very soon. After which point - once I have supplied my fingerprint to the App, there will be a further step to select which account I want to process.Finally, I have not encountered any bank charges - which is great.","Hi, Thank you for the lovely review and comments about your experience with opening an account.It's great to have you on board as a business account holder and we look forward to welcoming you as a personal account holder as well.Team Starling.",1363

"2789","Fergus",NA,1,NA,2019-07-24,2019-07-25,TRUE,"So far so good","So far so good. I tend to use Starling mainly as a travel money card. Initially I thought it would have poor rates and costs for exchanging but I’ve found it’s the opposite. I recently went to Prague but bought cash from M&S before going. I ended up needing to use my card to get public transport tickets so used my Starling card. After doing this I found the rates used on that account were far better than the cash rates at M&S and other places I also looked to buy cash. This saved me a lot of money in the end.I should note that I used the post office travel card on previous trips to Europe and it worked great but it didn’t have the Czech Koruna and you have to top up the card with minimum amounts of £50, whereas with Starling it doesn’t matter, you just have your account and spend like normal in the UK.Despite this, I still don’t use Starling as my main account, just because I’ve already got payments and income constantly coming out of another bank account from a separate bank but Starling is great for when I need to travel and I would highly recommend it, both as a trustworthy main account and travel card.","Hi Fergus,Thank you so much for leaving a great review.We’re big fans of taking some teal abroad and we’re glad you’re taking advantage of the great rates and free withdrawals and transactions.Team Starling",1123

If you have any issues though, the support is pretty poor and very awkward to access as everything has to go through the app.  Generally very slow to react and not that knowledgable.  You will get an answer in the end but it will take a bit of back and forth.Business account sign up is pretty awful as you have to deal with the support functions.  It took a couple of weeks to get a fully working business account for what should have been a very simple case.  Also, if you are using it for business then you will have to reconcile your transactions for your accounts.  This is really awkward as each entry in the app only shows the transaction cost and not the resulting account balance as you would expect to see.Ultimately, I would say that its fine for personal slush fund usage, but for business I would stick with a traditional bank despite their banking costs.","Hi Allen, We’re sorry that you haven’t had a positive experience with our customer service team, we want to provide helpful answers as quickly as possible through live chat, email and over the phone.

I think Starling would benefit from this.Another improvement would be easy access to paying in cheques; many banks and post offices don't accept them or know little about Starling so refuse to do it.

I read the hype about Starling Bank and thought I'd give it a go. The process of opening an account was done in minutes - literally no paperwork, no endless questions - just a very simple straightforward procedure. Within a few minutes the account was opened with an overdraft facility.The new debit card was received in a couple of days. The ability to select your own pin from your phone was a welcome surprise - no having to trudge off to a cash machine.Account best bits - without doubt instant notifications of any account activity - cash in or cash out, any spending, payments etc - you are notified immediately so your balance is always accurate - no waiting for pending payments to take effect. Your current balance is totally accurate which helps no end on budgeting on a daily basis. Not only that but from a security point of view I am aware of every account transaction as it happens so can quickly identify when something is wrong.Love the saving pots - a simple but brilliant idea.I feel so much more in control of my money, payments were easy to set up and I can easily see what payments are due to leave my account and when. The management of spending is easy to track - I can see where I am spending most of my money and how much - its pretty scary to see how often I visit a certain coffee shop!My advice is give the account a go - I am certainly impressed by the service, facilities that the account offers and customer service seems to be excellent. The high street bank is on the way out - my old bank seems so old fashioned in comparison, Starling is the future of banking.

"3085","Mark Richardson",NA,4,NA,2019-07-19,2019-07-19,TRUE,"A fresh approach to banking.","'Twas extremely easy to open an account with Starling having submitted my ID information online.  A decision to grant me an account was made within a few hours after verifying said ID.The Mastercard is fabulous when used in European countries and doesn't rack-up unacceptable exchange rate charges unlike some other financial institutions.  I have a Portuguese Husband and I was looking at opening a Euro account which Starling invited me to apply for.  This will come in extremely useful when travelling to countries where the Euro is the legal tender for making and receiving payments to and from family members and friends.  I'm particularly looking forward to the day when Starling enables payments from my Euro account using my UK Mastercard.They have a bank account switch facility which I'm considering using as I'm so impressed with Starling.  Paying cash into my account can be done at Post Offices which is much easier for me than having to hunt down a major bank branch when so many of them have closed for good.Starling has its limitations just the same as any bank and this bank may not be suitable for people who have no, or limited, technical ability.  For those of us who are comfortable with technology and banking online, it's a fresh, modern approach to online banking safe in the knowledge that a customer service team is available to help solve any issues.  Oh!  I almost forgot to mention that they pay a small amount of interest on current account balances too!","Hi Mark,We’re really happy to hear you’ve had a smooth experience so far.We agree that the MasterCard rates are awesome and hope you’re taking advantage of our free transactions and withdrawals abroad.Thanks for taking the time to leave us a lovely review.Team Starling",1484

May as well ask me to wash your car and then not provide the car to be washed!Tried speaking to Customer Service, which is a joke as when i called business support i was put thorough to someone who doesn't offer business support saying they'll pass it on and get back to me. Glad i didn't go with them seeing the reviews now.All banks are regulated! Al anyone needs is proof of ID and your incorporation documents.

First impressions, not good.","Hi Emily,Thank you for taking the time to leave your review. We appreciate the honest feedback and are sorry that your experience has not been that of what we strive to provide.You will need to visit a card terminal that does an online PIN check whilst doing an online transaction. We advise that you use a bank’s ATM as those are usually guaranteed to offer this type of transaction. The reason for this is to unblock your card, the card terminal needs to call our processor and “fetch” the unblock script that we ran.We suggest you try and withdraw cash from an ATM - if this works, then you’ll be able to use the card again normally, but if it doesn’t work, then the terminal didn’t do the correct type of PIN check.We hope that this info helps, but please get in touch if you need.Team Starling",584

We want our euro accounts to be as competitive as possible, and this small fee for making conversions covers the cost of converting from GBP to Euro and vice versa.Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review.

I chose Starling because I send money abroad and spend money abroad a lot - and they offer basically fee free spending and low fee sending.  I’ve used Starling as my main bank for around 6 months, and had to contact them 3 times, all over these services.On one occasion they failed to deliver money to a foreign account in the timescale quoted (it took 3 days instead of 1) and trying to get them to find out what was happening was a waste of time.On the other two occasions I have been charged unathorised fees by foreign merchants - and Starling have tried to make me feel like a liar and a cheat.  On the most recent occasion a German ATM helped themselves to €5.49 with no warning (I read screens very carefully) and Starling refused to dispute the charge without evidence (who actually videos themselves making every ATM withdrawal on the off chance it will rip you off with no warning).  2 calls and an email and I’m no further forward.  Their call centre staff are not trained to deal with anything out of the ordinary and stick to scripts by the letter - they may as well outsource them for all the use they are.  Even the High Street banks would have handled this better.Here’s hoping they fix the issues off the back of this, otherwise I’m off.And Starling, how about replying by reading what someone has written in full rather than just seeing a couple of key words.  Your replies in here quite clearly do nothing to address the complaints and simply wind people up with empty apologies and excuses.  If MasterCard rules wouldn’t hold up in a court of law, how about you use some common sense (just like I said, you side with your banking friends - although you even make TSB look amazing!)?  This is going to the ombudsman who I have no doubt will rule in my favour - otherwise let’s see if you defend this in court?","Hi Andrew, We’re sorry to hear that you’re unhappy with the outcome of the dispute you raised.

After I had done that there was STILL no way to get a receipt so I pressed the ""Cancel"" button and my card came out for me to retrieve.Minutes later, when I'm miles from the station I see on the APP that a second charge has appeared. So I contacted Starling immediately and gave them the full story. Their advice was ""don't worry - it'll disappear within a week.Well it didn't and now Starling say that - because I put py card and PIN in I am liable - EVEN THOUGH THE TRANSACTION WAS CANCELLEDKEEP AWAY FROM STARLING THEIR ADVICE IS RUBBISH AND JUST LETS MERCHANTS GET AWAY WITH IT.The real point with this particular case is that Starling KNOWS that I did not take the second lot of fuel.

Eg - if your direct debits come off at various times of month and you have a set weekly budget you can’t take money from any pot as just comes off current account . Or , if there was a direct debit / standing order pot that you could transfer into and direct debits could come out of them instead . Currently I’m using various pots which is fab but I’m transferring my weekly spending money into my Monzo account so I can keep track of my spending and not go over my weekly budget .

Their app is decent as well. But issues started as I made a transaction on my card that turned to be a scam (amount expected to be charged and actually charged was different). I reported the same immediately after the transaction was made and my experience has been horrendous. They do not understand consumer rights or the concept of chargeback and despite having provided all proof, they rejected my dispute. Customer service reps and even managers have been rude to the extent of putting down the phone on me and then being threatened the same by another - shell shocked with this kind of a response in a service industry - I would urge them to listen in to the calls to assess this behaviour from their customer facing reps and manager. I decided to report it to the Ombudsman and when I asked them for a final response to take it further, I was told that another team will get back to me within an indefinite period. I tweeted and complained via FB to Starling and even their famous CEO. Then I got a message via their 'Inbox' that my formal complaint is being considered and that they will get back to me within 15 days - am waiting in anticipation for their response.

"3585","Henry",NA,5,NA,2019-06-23,2019-06-23,FALSE,"I switched from First Direct, no regrets.","I switched from First Direct (a premium bank apparently) mainly because I’d grown to like the real time notifications I had on my American Express card, and a growing disenchantment with what’s basically HSBC and the banking sector in general. I wanted an actual bank, rather than a card you ‘load’ because that’s really not the same, so that’s N26 and Revolt our (or it was at the time), and as I’m over 40 I didn’t want the feeling that they’re pandering to ‘millennials’. Starling is a serious bank that is built from scratch and is modern in every way that means something. It’s not to say I’ve not had issues. I have. Cancelling direct debits (in error) and then reinstating them was impossible - Starling systems couldn’t cope, but that was eventually fixed. It was also weird that when they introduced banking at the Post Office, we all needed a new card. It is at least a nice one though, and feels more modern being vertically orientated. Getting through to customer services involved a long wait - but it does with a first Direct these days too, and generally this is infrequent. It does worry me however that it might be a deciding factor in the long term if/when there is a real problem. Reading some earlier reviews also give me pause - people describe a somewhat slapdash approach to verification and putting holds on accounts at Starling aren’t resourced or otherwise equipped to deal with quickly. Bad reviews are everywhere however, and there is often a sense that it’s not Starling’s fault. All in all, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Starling. My only request is that Goals have their transaction list, so they are more like the standalone accounts they really are. I’d like to see money going in and out of them so I can track savings, or spend that I want to keep separate from my main balance.","Hi Henry,Thanks for leaving your feedback.

If you see my transaction history a payment made of over £2500 which was from court and if you guys really want to test me I can get intouch with court to aprove the payment too. Why do you guys think it’s okay to put it under review for two months and not give me enough updates on this matter? This isn’t a joke.

Confirmed this on all accounts, they just ignored and closed each and every request.Raised another asking for a complaint to be raised as they had done this to which I was told multiple times (over each account) that I had not submitted the date of birth. Yet, it clearly shows in each of the messages raised. Apparently they cannot see it and I should send a screen shot.They use a third party helpdesk (ZenDesk) I believe, so clearly their integration is broken or the helpdesk provider is not up to scratch.

They requested proof of this transaction that didn't go through which I provided intantly. It has been restricted for 9 days now and no-one will talk to me noone will contact me it is all with a relevant department.Have been on their live chat everyday and someone eventually called me but was just another customer service rep. Apparently there were no notes on my account from all my prey conversations with love agents.I have asked twice a day everyday for 9 days for someone to contact me and I have heard absolutely nothing.Currently account is still restricted.

Just my balance and my wages go into the account. A bill has bounced which I am being charged for on top of all this. I have never experienced anything like this prior.

In 13 days my wages get paid into this bank account and currently I am unable to afford food or anything. As you have frozen my account.

Noone there is actually trying to help me 9 days if I was someone who had no family or friends then how could I be able to eat?

During the process she found out that only the Director can apply. This is very impractical but nevertheless, we got our Director to finish the application.After asking lots of questions about the nature of our business, Starling eventually rejected our application. They sent us a very unclear message ""explaining"" why - which referred us to their terms to check the businesses they don't accept and also said they only serve companies with 1 person of significant control.Well, our type of business was not on their banned list, and we only have 1 person of significant control. So we tried to find out the real reason they rejected us.This was like getting blood out of a stone and we had to have multiple sessions on Live Chat and over email with them. Live Chat told us this falls outside of their remit so we would have to repeat our messages to the business team over email - this is the type of bureaucracy you expect from a traditional bank. What's the point of Live Chat if they can't do anything?Eventually they told us the real reason why they rejected us - because the Director wasn't the person who originally downloaded the app and started the application. So they now think there is more than 1 person with access to the account and that goes against their terms - which is a ridiculous policy for a bank serving business to have in the first place. Of course this could be resolved by our Director restarting the application process and going through it entirely herself, but obviously Starling have not offered this to us. Continuously, they have given the impression that they don't really care about trying to meet the needs of their customers or help people open bank accounts. We have explained the situation to them multiple times - each time the person/platform we communicate with them on has no clue about the situation - but they are like a broken record, repeating their old, incorrect, lines about why they rejected us.We have asked to restart the application to solve the problem but now they've forgotten the real reason why they rejected us so they don't think this is a solution.We've given up on them now. I've got accounts with Monzo and Tide who are far better. Starling has the customer service of a traditional bank with bits of technology from newer banks. This makes it even more frustrating to deal with them as you expect communicating with them to be seamless. It's not joined up enough though, so you end up repeating yourself constantly, and their customer service reps are hopelessly unclear and take an age to understand the situation.",NA,2759

They offer a terrible quality of customer service when it comes to dispute requests. Most high street banks protect consumer rights, if there is poorly offered/incomplete service provided by merchants, whereas Starling simply denies this type of requests, largely due to their weak support team. They violate mastercard and payments council regulations. As such requests are time-intensive and laborious they simply deny. Also they claim to offer mastercard fx rate for international purchases and withdrawals, which is usually 1 or 2% lower than advertised mastercard rates, they specifically choose the least favourable rate during the trading day, in order to satisfy the minimum legal requirements. For example if GBP EUR is floated between 1,15 and 1,17 during the day, they reflect euro expenses from the 1,15 rate the lowest on that day.","Hi Adnan,We’re sorry to hear that you feel this way. Starling will always operate according to MasterCard regulations. We can see that you have been in contact with our team and that they are looking into this for you. Once we have an update we will send this to you directly.We will use the live MasterCard exchange rate on the day that the transaction settles.

There are no charges for everyday banking, bounced direct debits and the likes and that has saved me a fortune. The app is virtual always available (I've never known it to be unavailable) Transactions are instant so as soon as I'm paid, Starling tells me. If a company takes £1 from your account to validate a method of payment, Starling tells you instantly unlike every other bank that makes me wait 4 days to find out who has taken and why. I can stop my card at any time and unlock it just as easily which is great if I think I might have mislaid my wallet. My only worry was paying in to my account and I received a cheery email to tell me I can pay in my Starling account at any Post Office in the country! That's THOUSANDS of branches and it takes THIRTY SECONDS to do it. It has saved me SO much money in transport costs as there were no branches near me with my old bank. Sending money is fast, receiving money is instant and the app gets better and better every time it's updated. If I have a cheque which is very rare, I can send it to FREEPOST STARLING and get it cashed in a few days. Not perfect but cheques are a thing of the past for me - except hopefully a lotto cheque! Lastly, the thing that really grinds my gears is online banking downtime. It has happened TWICE and it was for 3 hours at 4am on a Sunday and I was given plenty of warning. One bank used to just be offline for ten hours with NO notice! Honestly the bank is amazing and customer service is quick through the app and they are very friendly and helpful.

I looked forward to finally ridding myself of HSBC, which must be one of the worst banks around.  I use my middle name and am known by that name rather than my first name. My signature is, and has always been, my middle name and surname. Under section 2 on my driving license both names are listed and my signature on the license is middle and last. When I applied for the account, I entered my first and middle name as requested, assuming that both would be on my card and account the way they are shown on my HSBC accounts and cards. However, my account only showed my first name. I used the chat function to try to sort this out, but was told that nothing could be changed since I had entered my middle name in the middle name section. If I had put both in the first name section it would have been fine, apparently, but it could not be changed after the fact. Despite my license showing both.  When I asked if I could cancel the account and reapply, putting my first and middle name in the first name section, I was told that I could but would then not be able to apply for another account for 12 months. And when I told the CS rep that even awful HSBC could do this, his response was:""I do understand what you are saying, it is a very simple request. A high street bank can complete this request in a simple and easy manner. As i have explained already we are an app based bank and depend on what is submitted."" So, for some reason, Starling cannot process simple requests the way high street banks can? It makes no sense. I cancelled the account and hope that another online bank will be more interested in my business.Update 1: I contacted customer support via email and they fixed this immediately, so I’m all set. Thank you.  All’s well that ends well! Looking forward to using my account.Update 2: I spoke too soon. Received my card today and it only had my first name and not middle or middle initial. I’ve contacted CS again to ask them to fix this and am hoping that will be smooth. Will update once I’ve heard back.Update 3: heard back that they cannot change the name on my card despite what was said before. These people don’t seem to have a clue. In 2019, you’d expect that they would be able to do what every other high street bank is able to do, i.e. put two initials on a debit card. If they can’t do something so simple, why would I trust them with my money and business?They all seem to be saying different things too, which reminds me a lot of HSBC.

It’s simple, it’s informative, it’s great! Where it really shines above traditional bank cards is when travelling abroad… no fees, no dire exchange rates (if fact, on my last trip, the Starling rate was better than I would have got from buying euro-cash at my local bank) and it gives almost instant on-screen notification of the sterling cost of your last purchase and a running balance. It also categories spend into ‘types of spend’ - which I’ve been doing manually for years on an excel spreadsheet - now Starling does it all for me (win:win!). If you’re on this website, looking at reviews to decide whether to sign-up for a Starling card: just do it - especially if your first requirement is to use a debit card abroad.

I was a little disappointed at first when I couldn’t just have a business account (sole trader) and had to have a personal account too. I soon changed my mind. If like me you have thought for years that high street banks are not taking full advantage of the mobile platform then Starling is for you. In simple terms, no fuss. Branches of high street banks closing down all the time, not a problem. Cash paid in at the post office, cheques paid in at the post box. No mess. The only point to note is that transactions get removed from your available funds straight away. This, for me is great as I hated seeing transactions in my pending folder for days, in Starling, the updated balance is done instantly. The app is fantastic, if at fist a little confusing (but you’ll soon pick it up). Transactions are broken down into merchant and category. I used to use Yolt to manage all of this stuff, but I will soon be getting rid of it and using Starling instead. My ONLY concern is that I want more freedom with categories, namely custom categories. I want to be able to categories transactions as drinks, fuel, car maintenance, etc. The only way I can see this happening is to give custom categories.  This would allow me to track my spending much more wisely. On the whole, absolutely no reservations at all, I would recommend them to anyone. Their customer service is fantastic. All questions answered in a number of minutes and by a very friendly bunch of customer service staff, and the overall service is fantastic. I would just revert to my first point. If you like going in to a bank, then Starling obviously isn’t for you. But for everyone else in the world like me who is savvy with technology and can’t remember the last time they went to a branch of their bank, then Starling is for you.",NA,1904

Upon my return I transferred any remaining money into my main current account 18 working days later I received a message from Starling Bank stating "" one of my transactions had changed"".

Initial setup process was really quick and easy, but after few successful days of operation the new account was suspended with no advanced notification or clear reason provided. The app is constantly asking to submit ID, while showing ''account is ready, let's go'' at the same time, which doesn't work by pressing. I have to delete the app and re-login each time to bypass ID request. Anyway, IDs were submitted twice, all questions were answered and applications submitted, copies were sent, however, no reply to any message, inexistent customer service, live chat (if you are lucky to login to the app) is useless since they cannot provide any information regarding sudden account suspension and endless another verification process. Eventually, I have a problem with card payments provider due to unsuccessful direct credits they were processing to Starling account. As a result money stuck and I have no idea how to get them. Moreover, my shop cannot accept cards now and we are cash only. Its been a couple of weeks since switching to Starling and I am loosing 'no cash' customers every day. Upcoming weekend is very important for my small business, but I am not ready for it. Furthermore, money in Starling account are frozen too. I have no words to explain the damage and inconvenience caused. Next door shops are with different digital banks and none of them faced such problem for one good reason - none of them with Starling. We all make bad decisions sometimes.

All was going well for a couple of months after setting up a new business account with Starling making and receiving payments, then after receiving a CHAPS payment from a customer for stock my account was restricted. This was 6 weeks ago and I’m unable to pay anybody let alone myself with all funds frozen. All Direct Debits have failed and I’m incurring extra fees with my suppliers. I’m unable to invoice for any of my work as I don’t want the money to be frozen too. I have provided Starling with invoices and proof of the transfer made by my customer as they requested and now it’s gone quiet with no response for weeks. I’m now filing a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service as 6 weeks seems unreasonable to me. I understand that they may need to verify the source of these funds but I have done this. I’m now left having to go to a high street bank to open a new account as I can’t wait any longer.UPDATE: Starling reply to the review here but after emailing them as advised 3 days ago I’ve still had no response!UPDATE: now 2 months and no access to my funds. How can it possibly take this long! I’ve provided all the information requested and the company who was sender of the payment has provided a lot of information and proof of the source of funds. I’ve heard back from the Financial Ombudsman and they are now investigating this. Be warned if you are thinking of using Starling for your business.

Even after their decision to close my account in 4 weeks, they did not allow me to transfer my own money back to my own personal account that they came from. They asked to wait few weeks and then they will send it via cheque or transfer back...Meanwhile I went to my HSBC brunch which took me two weeks to open a business account.

Fast, Fresh, Simple.","After using Starling for about a year, I decided to switch to them as my main bank. I’ve been with Barclays for 30 years, but the stubbornness of the old High St Banks is beginning to show their clunky systems and clunky attitude. In fact when I tried to close my Barclays account, it took a month and a team of specialists - and they never adequately explained their charges during this period either. The attitude of Starling is completely different: Fresh, fast, simple. I usually get payment notifications before a shop has even finished the transaction on the till - and the ease with which I can now manage payments and standing orders is amazing.

I was sent an abundance of information from Natwest with 'carefully selected' offers for switching business banking accounts. It took quite a while to submit the application before being told that the application had been rejected. Whilst I appreciate applicants must pass credit checks (I requested no borrowing, but am a small business with limited records so was slightly reluctant anyway) it is a burden when applicants are deceived in such a way which would compel them onto thinking they have already been accepted, (in principal.) Then they would not be required to waste any of their time. I suspect Natwest are partly to blame for this... their marketing throughout the switch process is a little confusing. But the other parties play a part too. The best part of this process has lead me to believe that I remain happy with my current business bank.","Hi Andrew,Thank you for your review.We are sorry we have not been able to offer you an account at this time.

However, when I noticed the status of verification, we decided to contact customer service who advised of an issue between the name on his ID and the account (Just a middle name missing), after confirming his name in full, he was advised that all was OK and it had been passed on to the relevant team. Now almost a month later, his salary has been paid in and he cannot access any of his money. Customer service has been hugely unhelpful: firstly being cut off in the chat without warning, and then having to explain everything again to another operator, only to be told to call them. Then after calling and being cut off by 2 separate operators, he was told that it can take some time to process (3 weeks to process a simple change is totally unacceptable in my opinion!) and now he has been told to wait and will be sent a message this afternoon (that's not to say it will be resolved).

She said the system always goes the other way. Maybe the system let you pass in the past but it doesn’t mean you’ll pass every time. And it’s not her business, not their fault but ours. How ridiculous is this! This is a bank, not some crappy company. So we asked again if we can have a customer service to call us back or transfer us to.

Mostly it is as advertised. However there is one aspect of their claims on their website which simply is not true. In relation to Euro accounts the site says ""This account is currently available to customers who joined our waitlist"". I joined the waiting list some time ago and therefore expected to have access to a Euro account.  Their claim is clear - I was on the waiting list and so the Euro account was ""currently available"" to me. Except that it isn't. In online chat the story changes. The account isn't currently available to all those on the waiting list. It is being made available to them over a period (unspecified) of time. What is important here is not that I don't have access to a Euro account today (I can wait) but that Starling make a false claim on their web site. It would have been trivial to change the text to read along the lines of ""currently being made available"" to describe a work in progress. However the text as displayed explicitly claims a functioning capability which in practice isn't there. How many other falsehoods are there in Starling claims? If they are prepared to tell porkies in this instance where else are they misleading us?----------------------------------------------- Added after response from StarlingThere is no confusion - at least not on my part. Euro accounts are still not available to customers who were on the waiting list. That claim is quite simply false.

"5211","NT",NA,1,NA,2019-02-01,NA,TRUE,"Starling is superb","Starling is superb - it's quick, easy and efficient banking! Starling is the best example of what a digital bank should be like. (1) I love that it gives me instant notifications (unlike traditional banks with their limited text alerts). Another thing I like is that if I spend in Tesco, for example, I can see Tesco's icon in the thumbnail which is very intuitive when I check back where I've spent my money on (2) You may think another bank does this as well, but overall, Starling is better and here's why. It is better than all challenger banks and I know that because I have an account with all of them. (3) Their application is quick, easy and efficient. (4) It is better than Monzo in terms of user interface and security (Monzo does not have fingerprint entry to app, which is shocking - anyone who uses your phone will be able to enter Monzo unlike with Starling which has fingerprint, as do almost all other banking apps to be fair), (5) it is better than N26 which does not save payee information unlike Starling that allows me to save information of all payees. (6) It is better than both N26 and Monzo in terms of 'spaces' or 'jam jars'. I can open as many spaces as I want, unlike with others which want premium or other membership for opening more spaces. (7) it is reliable, unlike B bank which has an opaque application system and where your money tend to mysteriously disappear one day and mysteriously come back the next time (8) It is FSCS protected which gives me peace of mind (unlike Revolut, which now has a European banking license and in other respects is great). You can use Starling abroad (not the inter-bank rates that Revolut has to offer, but great still as they don't charge commission)  (9) it has a quick 'Apple Pay' box making it easy to add to your Apple Wallet, which is again efficient. Only other bank that does this is Monzo (10) you get 0.5% interest with Starling which is great compared to many current accounts (including traditional banks).What can be improved / added: (1) customer service is okay, I have tried to contact them and found it easy, although some traditional banks offer quicker service with shorter response time. Could add a digital assistant to screen questions that require standard responses. After the digital assistant cannot answer your question, could add the option to call them (2) interest rates could be improved and Starling could introduce a savings account. Another challenger, B Bank offers 1% on savings and 0.5% in current but if Starling offered a savings account with competitive rates, I'd definitely open one. (3) I've always known that Starling was better than Monzo, even though many people I knew used Monzo more than Starling. This was because Monzo was heavily advertised everywhere, especially in tube stations. Since the new year began, I've noticed Starling put up loads of ads in high-traffic tube stations. I seriously hope that with more number of potential customers, their service quality remains unaffected! At the moment, Starling provide excellent service! I hope they continue to provide quick, easy and efficient banking. I would not hesitate in recommending Starling bank - a well-deserved five stars!!",NA,3205

"5403","RuthD",NA,9,NA,2019-01-22,2019-01-24,FALSE,"Bleeding edge - to a point..","Updated Review from original;I'm actually switching out of Starling, after less than two weeks.  Here's the rationale;On the positive side, it is a really good mobile phone app, I've been able to pay bills out of it no problem and moving money is effortless.  I also loved the fact that I could pay out in other currencies and not get bank charged for it.On the negative side.  The customer service chat in phone drives me crazy, on one I lost 10% battery life because they aren't always the fastest in getting back to you.  Emailing was worse, it's over 24 hours before they get back to you. If I lose my mobile phone Starling lock my account (as they should).  However I can't make any transactions myself until I get a new handset.  No phone banking, nothing online, it is just mobile.  And mobile handsets get stolen.  It feels a bit 'eggs in one basket'.  The app also has failed to integrate with my accounting software, so at the moment I'm having to do everything manually.What matters to me?  That I can have access to my banking whether I have a phone on me or not.  That it works with my accounting software.  That if I have an issue, I can talk to somebody about it.  Starling is a bit too edgy for people like me I think, but it has been useful in actively demonstrating that confining all your online banking activities to a mobile phone is not a viable solution if you need to be able to access your money in any eventuality.  For a niche audience I'm sure it's great.  But I've given it a chance, however I don't think money management should be cool, it should be effective and reassuringly boring.  So I'm going to a bank a still offers the phone banking app, as well as online, phone and good old fashioned branches.  After all this, that feels quite novel!..................Original Review;I've set up a business banking account with Starling, and have found their customer service team polite and proactive, and the app is clean and easy to use.However, they started out by putting my home address as my business address (even though they have the business address) which is a bit worrying.  Setting it up with Xero was a bit of a ball-ache, and in addition, I should have read the small print more closely, if you lose your mobile phone or it is stolen, while the team will help keep the account secure, you can't actually access your banking, or do any banking until the next phone arrives.  Starling say that their app will also work on some tablets, so hopefully I'll be able to have a backup in place.  They are still pretty new, and I imagine things will evolve in future, obviously now I'm more anxious about my mobile phone handset than I used to be and also a bit disappointed, that there isn't a little more thought in place for a helpful backup if things go wrong.","Hi Ruth, thanks for your feedback.Glad to hear that you like the app and that you have had a good experience with our customer service team.We are sorry to hear that there were issues setting up your Xero account - please don't hesitate to get in touch if there is anything that we can do to help with this!If you have an iPad we would recommend setting up your app there just in case something happens to your phone.We are always looking for ways to improve as we grow, and have passed your feedback on to our team.Thanks for leaving a review.",2796

None of the high street banks wanted to create an account for me because they needed bills, letter from Council tax as proof of address which I couldnt provide as I just came to the country, couldn't rent a whole property (no credit history, of course). And if you don't have a bank account, you can't have a legal job because you can't have your salary on anything, right? So it was a suffer until one of my friends recommended Starling. Very modern, the online banking system is easy to use and very nice. They accept the Starling Mastercard anywhere, and if you keep your money at Starling, they grow that amount monthly.

The app is easy to use, ordering my card was painless and hassle-free, and all of the usual banking functions such as payments/transfers, PIN reminders, even locking/unlocking your card are quick and easy to carry out instantly, with notifications showing up instantly on my phone for the items I wish to see, which is exactly how modern banking should be!My favourite feature is the savings 'spaces' or goals feature, which lets you set up a space (or multiple spaces) within your account to store money for certain things, so whilst the money is still in your account it doesn't appear in the main balance. I am terrible at spending money when I have it in my account, and I sometimes get caught out by payments that I forget about, for example car insurance or an annual subscription. Let's say I have to pay £120 every year for a membership; with the savings spaces I set up a space with my goal as £120, and at the start of each month I tell the app to put £10 in the space.  When the £120 payment rolls around, I just 'withdraw' the £120 back into my account balance and start saving again for next year! One advantage of this over a separate savings account is if I need to use my overdraft - the money in all of my savings spaces is still actually in my account, so I can go overdrawn up to the combined total and not be charged (continue to earn interest in fact).I also love the monthly spending information, which you can view line by line, or the app will also display the information grouped into categories, eg. groceries, entertainment, etc. which is far easier to read than a traditional bank statement, and can easily be altered if the payment has been categorised incorrectly by the app. Other banks have also now begun to offer this type of information more and more, but I have yet to see it implemented as well as Starling does it!Opening an account with Starling has enabled me to take control of my finances with far greater transparency than the apps of the four other more 'mainstream' banks that I've had prior to this, and it has genuinely been an enjoyable experience! This year I've managed to navigate the Christmas period, which is usually a horrendous time for finances, and stay out of the red to somehow come out on top! Thank you Starling!",NA,2388

I opened a business account. They required a few things for verification, which I supplied, and a few days later it was approved, and a debit card promptly followed. I talked to colleagues about the simple process and that I couldn't wait to shift my banking across to it.Then, 2 days after receiving the card, I received a message saying that they needed more information to verify the account - fine, but it had already been verified. I could understand that with a business account they'd need some more documentation to ensure I was actually the business (and they need to protect themselves from money-laundering schemes). I read the message at around 4-4:30pm on Thursday.I attempted to log into the app the next morning, 15 hours later, and they had reversed the verification and locked me out of the app, requiring me to verify again. This meant that I did not have any access to my account. Closing accounts is covered by government regulation, but is the locking out of the app, which is the only viable means of accessing the account, covered? It's not. It's very thin ice they're treading on, and I wouldn't trust them to not remove the access to your own account without warning - simply by locking you out of the app. If it wasn't a week of wrapping up projects before Christmas I would have already transferred my business account across to them. Thankfully I didn't, so it's business as normal. Conclusion? Avoid them for business accounts. I have had zero issues with Monzo for my personal account, so after this experience, I would even suggest Monzo over Starling for personal accounts. Also, their support chat page has the worst autocorrect I have ever seen on a mobile phone. I don't know exactly how a webpage corrects text so badly, but if you need support, contact them from a PC.","Hi Jono, we are very sorry to hear of your experience when opening a business account, especially as you had passed on positive sentiment after completing the sign up process.

Starling has so far provided just the service I have always wanted and the offering is getting better with other financial service providers being able to be accessed via the Starling mobile platform.",NA,679

My partner banks with Starling and everytime i transfer money from my Halifax account to his Starling account, it debits the amount again from my account the next day!! so double money comes out each time! This began in August and continued until November- a total of £1,050 has been debited from my account to 'Starling Bank Ltd' and i have only ever received £150.00 back! Additionally our rent was taken from the Starling account and our landlord never received it- another £700 plus GONE. We have experienced multiple amounts of missing money and in total we are owed approx. £2,025! Just what we would need around this time of year! Starling have continued to say they have sent us cheques...but cant give us a tracking number. And initially the bank transfer 'never worked' multiple times (considering this is an online bank this sounds pretty ridiculous), therefore the decision was made for a cheque to be sent, 2 weeks on no cheque and no tracking number! HILARIOUS! Now we are waiting on an email so we can send the Ombudsman! But even that is like getting blood out of stone! HOW CAN A BANK BLATENTLY STEAL FROM PEOPLE!?And yes I received a response to my complaint email from someone named Ashleigh who advised the debits were used by my card and I should contact my bank for potential fraud, however when my partner then called Starling after this response from Ashleigh and another member of the customer care team advised that Ashleigh shouldn’t be saying that and there’s notes on my partners files saying that the money being taken is definitely an error on your behalf. My partner, Nik then replied to the email asking for Ashleigh to call him and received no response! We have called again today demanding an email so we can take it the ombudsman.... STILL WAITING!!

With regard to the features that are meant to set the bank apart from the traditional banking app and for it to be the bank of the future these need to be developed. For example the app can recognise types of expenses but you need to be able to analyse your spending habits easier and set budgets within the app.The app in the market store need to improved as most of the categories are ""coming soon"" for ages now. The apps that are there may be useful to others but I don't have any use for them.I like that the account credits interest but i believe that it should be in line with at least the bank of England rate.All in all its a very good app and can be used as your sole bank account now that you can deposit cash at the post office.","Hi Michael, thanks for your feedback.

Only downside is currently if you need to pay money in either cash or cheque it’s not as easy to do as no branches so you have to post it off or go to a NatWest for cash deposits. It would be good if somehow you could take a pic of the cheque upload it to starling who can then process in that manner maybe? But over all fantastic bank and I would highly recommend them!",NA,622

This has resulted in having my council tax recalculated as the direct debit would be missed. Also the account doesn’t accept payments in USD. This is a problem for me as I receiving proceeds from sales of shares and company expenses in USD. I’m sure this is something that can easily be negotiated with the likes of MasterCard or other providers and needs to be done ASAP. In addition, sometimes I can’t use my Starling card in certain retailers, the error is normally that the ‘Card Scheme Not Accepted’ on their terminal. Starling tell me this is because the retailer needs to update their terminal, however I don’t think this is a valid solution and it sometimes means I’m stuck without being able to pay for things as this is now my only current account.",NA,1045

Also the notifications for every transaction are instantaneous and very helpful. The customer service is much better than my previous main bank (Barclays).

That is just sooo helpful to help me manage my money that I wouldn’t want to live without it now :) not to forget the cool icons that show you on what company you spent the money on, instead of random code names in your bank statement, where it takes ages to figure out what it was. That being said, in the email it asked me for suggestions to being even better. So I will say some things that bothered me somewhat. That still takes nothing away from them and is just what I find a bit annoying. Suggestion: One thing is that i use my bank card for my bus/train travel to and from work. Then I get daily notifications about ‘tfl blablabla’ and then another how much it cost me for that day per day.

Secondly the limitations on withdrawing from account it is limited to £300 a day at the post office and card, i would hope to see that increase over time. I keep my rbs account for these 2 reasons only but all my banking is done through starling rbs is there as backup only. at the moment i am very pleased with my move to starling and i am enjoying being part of the journey watch this bank transform into something phenomenal.

An app for the Apple Watch is a big thing! I hope they do this in the future.The one massive thing that would be brilliant is in relation to their goals tab. If I have a pot of £100 for a months worth for food at work then it would be so good if you can buy from your workplaces canteen for example and then link that purchase and all future purchases with that provider to your goal. There for in the future it could just deduct money from your money pot when you spend.

The opening process was very quick and easy and the user experience so far has been fantastic.The interface on the app is logical, straight forwards and efficient making it very easy to manage my money. Travelled abroad during the summer and was able to take advantage of the excellent exchange rates that Starling provide.My only gripe would be the lack of a decent interest rate for savings, with the Spaces element of the app only paying a few basis points. It's fine for day to day management of small sums however definitely isn't suitable for anything larger than a few hundred quid. Not to say that the functionality isn't good, it is and cleverly allows you to segment cash within your account, it's just that having the option to open a fully fledged savings account would be more convenient.Have had to call Customer Services a couple of times for help with the app or some advice and have again found the experience refreshing. Managed to get through almost straight away and found both members of staff to be very pleasant and professional resolving my query within a couple of minutes.All in all I'm very, very happy with Starling.

I found the signing up process extremely easy and straightforward. 24 hours customer service comes in very handy for those who, like me, work shifts and cannot always contact a traditional bank within their opening hours. I had a few teething problems at first but these were quickly sorted out apart from one issue when I was switching from Natwest with a £1k overdraft. Starling did not transfer the overdraft and to this day keep saying I am ineligible and to try again in three months. Six months have passed and they still haven't approved it. For this reason I only give three out of five stars As an overdraft and a switch from one bank to another for a like for like service including the Direct Debits is a pretty important feature. The app is reliable and I have never had a problem with it or their customer service (apart from the above mentioned overdraft) instant notifications about incoming and outgoing funds is really handy and the app really helps you to keep on top if your finances. I would recommend Starling to anyone and have done. My only reservation is if you use the switching service, l highly recommend not to close your existing account until Starling has correctly moved EVERYTHING across. I am still sceptical because of the 'teething problems I have experienced and the overdraft situation.","Hi Gabriel, very sorry to hear of your experience when switching from NatWest. In most circumstances we will be happy to review overdrafts and look to match these prior to switching. In order to do so we would need to request 3 months worth of statements from your previous bank in over to assess your eligibility. If you are able to submit these again or alternatively provide your consent for a soft credit check as part of re running your eligibility, we'll be happy to review this for you.",1384

Yet still none of the legacy bricks and mortar banks that led us into the 2008 crash show any signs of reform, modernising, being interactive or disrupting their century old traditions.  The banking arena needed a huge shake-up and a handful of new banks took on the job.

The basics are done well or at least as good as any other bank. The real time notifications and settlement of most transactions is a real benefit to managing money with care. However my experience with customer service has not lived up to expectations. I have been with Starling since July 2017 and have had a few interactions with Starling support. This is either an area of the bank they don’t care about, don’t give enough resource and training too or maybe they are in denial about it. This opinion is not the result of a single incident but has been formed by a pattern of behaviour I have observed over the time I have been with the bank. Issue range from the ticketing system being next to useless. Staff clearly not reading the information carefully you have given them. Taking over a week to get an initial response. Closing tickets before I have confirmed the issue is resolved. The list goes on and on.UPDATE After Starling Bank posted their response.I seem to be very unlucky then. In fact I have ticket open at the moment that is 5 days and counting waiting for a reply. So my luck still seems to be no where to be seen.","Hi Jonathan, sorry to hear that your customer service experience has not lived up to expectations.

I just get an error message saying I have no internet connection and please try later despite me being connected to home Wi-fi with full 4G signal.The agents on the phones are polite enough but are unable to do anything except pass it to a different team and then nothing happens.

It just isn’t acceptable to leave a customer unable to access their account with no updates or explanation.

Barclays asked me to approach the bank I am now with...That's when the depth of their ability is totally inadequate.

Be warned, customer services is as basic as it gets. Also when pressed to read and reply to my points they don't answer ever again. Totally ignored..Update 31st October.Still no reply from customer service. Matter being professionaly dealt with by Barclays and the insane, unhinged AMAZON.

High Street banks and building societies are offering little or no customer service in my view and are basically a sales force selling products from credit cards to loans even if in some cases you don’t need them. Starling for me works really well. Things that separate Starling from others:1) Ease of opening an account. All done through app. No need to post Identification.2) Instant notifications on mobile when transaction is made, even with overseas payments shows sterling cost as well as foreign currency.3) Instant account balance adjustment after any transactions. Previous bank could takes days to show payment.4) Breaks down spending into different categories ie entertainment, fuel, groceries etc. Makes it super easy to monitor spending.5) Can set own overdraft from nothing to max based on limit given by Starling.6) Live online chat and quick to respond to emails.7) can setup different pots within account for whatever you like ie holidays, new car etc. Any money in those pots are removed from account balance, making it less likely to spend your savings.8) Pays interest and works with Apple Pay.9) unsure of a particular transaction... click it and the app shows you on map where the transaction happened.10) Ability to turn on and off card or stop online transactions instantly.From time to time I come across issues but over the time I have banked with them, most of these have been sorted out.",NA,1474

I got an email that my acccoubt is restricted and clarification about a payment the previous day. I replied immediately as the payment was from my partner. I got another email informing me I will get an update soon as they are reviewing my account. I emailed on 9/10/2018 asking why there’s still no update and they responded with my account is under review and will get back to me as soon as possible. I sent another email on 17/10/2018 asking if my direct debit will be paid as they are due soon. I called after 48hrs as I had no response to my email. The person I spoke with on the phone asked me what outcome am after. Am I looking to close the account to which I said no. I want access to my money. I sent another email asking for the complaints department.  The same person that emailed me about the review responded to my email telling me they have decided to close my account and I will get my balance by check under their terms and conditions. I sent him an email stating that their terms and conditions stipulates 2 months written notices  and I am allowed to get my balance by bank transfer. It also says they will be liable if my direct debit fails. He says I should make alternative arrangement for my account. I have asked him how it is possible to make arrangement for a payment that’s coming out on 22/10/18 when he’s informing me on Friday 19/10/18. He emailed twice in a day after ignoring me for 48hours. I never got any response about the complaints department.

Complete lack of follow-through, and I think this shows where the focus of the bank is, just operating as a normal bank, but with a beastly app solution.And so on to the good bits: the app is actually really damn good. Payments come through immediately, the functionalities are excellent, it's really refined, the UX is top notch, and it's easy to pay invoices, set up payees, analyse your spending, set financial goals for internal projects, etc. Can't fault the technology at all, apart from maybe the lack of an e-card which is a bit of a shame (either that, or I've missed the functionality altogether, somehow). So hats off to the design and dev team, it's really a superb product.SUCH a shame the customer service, complaints handling, chat staff, and service phone are such a horrific nightmare, or this would be a 5* review and I would likely close my HSBC account and work solely through Starling. Don't promise to fix a problem THREE times and make ZERO effort to actually do so.

I used to bank with First Direct who are renowned for excellent customer service and answering the phone quickly. However, I came to realise that in 9 out of 10 times that I had to call FD it was because of an issue created by FD in the first place. I decided to look for an alternative bank and I narrowed the choices to between Starling and another challenger bank and I chose Starling. I chose Starling Bank based on YouTube videos and reviews of the bank on TrustPilot. My prediction was that by switching to a digital only bank, I would have to spend less time calling FD/my new chosen challenger bank less, if at all. So far, so good and the mere thought of having to use another bank fills me with dread.As I was a bit skeptical at first, I tested the Starling Bank customer service via their website prior to switching and the customer service is very good. It is early days however since switching to Starling I have experienced no adverse issues. Any questions I have raised have been answered quickly and professionally by the team in the Starling app. You even get to keep a copy of the chat in the app. Brilliant! As Starling Bank have no High Street branches at all, the app is the primary way you will manage your money. Therefore, it's crucial that the app is easy to use and Starling does not disappoint. Starling have made a fantastic banking app with a lot of useful and innovative features. You can create a UK bank account from anywhere you have an internet connection in 5 minutes using this app. I opened my account from my sofa. It’s so easy it’s unbelievable. The Starling Bank app has been designed from the ground up, and the amount of thought and consideration that has gone into developing this app is clear. The Starling Bank app makes the High Street banks' attempts at online banking look like amateur hour. There are so many innovative features including the 'Pulse' home screen, INSTANT transaction notifications (an alert comes up on your phone the moment the transaction is made), nearby payments to other Starling Bank account holders, debit card controls e.g. freezing/unfreezing your card and a Market Place. Goals is also a fantastic feature. This is a feature where you can set up multiple savings pots without having to create extra accounts. The list of fun and useful features is so long and definitely worth checking out. I am thoroughly enjoying using the app which actually makes managing my finances fun. Most importantly, Starling Bank are part of the FSCS so you're protected up to £85000 if anything should go awry. This gave me great peace of mind when switching.

I am a British Citizen and a UK resident, I have Bank accounts with other UK banks, I have never in my life missed a payment nor have I been convicted of Fraud or anything of the sort, I have checked my credit score as suggested by Hardeep and it shows up as GOOD, so why then have they refused my application?! Is it because I am Asian? Or because I am muslim? They refuse to tell me why and when I asked if I can apply again, they said I have to wait 12 months! Please can someone provide me with any insight as in to why they're refusing me AND then refusing to tell me why.

Loved the UI, but found the pre-paid card limited with functionality and plus as an early adopter I was slightly disappointed with how slow it was to get onto the current account round. Plus introducing charges for withdrawal abroad put me off.Atom was just a savings account - I understood it's function and how it could help, but I found my own investment ISAs were pulling in almost quadruple returns. Loot I just thought lacked everything... The only thing I liked was the see through card... Starling just provided me with the functionality that Monzo lacked due to having a fully fledged banking license at forst - it had an alright/on-par UI to Monzo - and it hadn't introduced charges for foreign withdrawals. Plus it had better open banking integration right from the outset (think Moneybox).If you think Monzo is top-dog the good luck to you - I think the company is doing very well for itself (I am a crowd investor) and has great adoption.

My Wife and I both have personal accounts on our phones and they work fine. The concept and execution are great.I also took on a business account and on my phone, it's fine. But I cannot work out how to add it to hers.All they said in the email was that we had reached the limit.  There are only two devices!  Also, they said call us. Right then. How long have you got? I waited upwards of 20 minutes listening to some awful hold music and no answer. So I tried the chat system.12 people in front of me. 10 minutes later, 12 people in front of me. 20 minutes later, 9 people in front of me.It seems that the customer support team are far too small to support the system.I love the idea of no fees but it also needs to be of a usable quality with decent support.

Took a gamble at an online challenger bank, being apprehensive of something only via app but willing to try.  On the first day of opening the account my fears were realised.  Poor and amateurish Service.Set up a business account via the app, for a company that was a start up and never traded before.  Account was set up, number and sort code provided.  Went through the validation process, including indicating that the company does not yet have a website or social media pages, as it hasn’t started trading yet.  Their system advises this won’t be a problem and asked for extra info instead, which I provided.The next day an email asking for our web address or social media.  Advised the same thing, that we don’t have them yet, as need a bank account first.  He replied, and asked for an inbound invoice instead.  Replied again, we don’t have any in-bound invoices yet, as we need an account first to pay them from.No reply - left in limbo. Called the customer service number and after being on hold spoke to ‘a member of staff’, and advised the above.  After much being placed on hold he advised that despite them already providing an account number and sort code, they wouldn’t open an account - (somewhat contradictory?!)After more holding was told that it’s their policy for start ups to have either a website or inbound invoices.  By this token I can’t see how they can ever get any start ups opening accounts with them as the first thing a business looks to do is open a bank account. Advised I will now make an FCA complaint, on the grounds of unacceptable, misleading service and unreasonable terms of service.From now on I’ll steer clear of Starling, as traditional banks probably offer comparable or better levels of service, and have had many more years to realise what are ridiculous requirements and eradicate them.  Starling seems to have much to learn before it’s quite fit-for-purpose as a business account provider.

The worst I've ever experiencedI paid for flights from my Starling account. The transaction was identified as non secure for the merchant.

She first said, 'i cannot, i'm afraid', 2 min later, she said 'sorry, i can' (simple rule, capital letter to start a sentence and 'I' is always capital). Didn't get the statement, instead I got an email from her saying '...we are unfortunately unable to open an account for you at this time'. I didn't requested an account opening and it has been 30 min that we are in the chat. I explained that I received the wrong email from her, without the attachment I was waiting for. Olivia: 'I do sincerely apologies' without any follow up. Me: 'I need to go to a meeting, can I count on you to send the statement to my email'. She said she did twice, I haven't received anything. Almost an hour in the chat... I answered her email and asked her to attach the statement to the same email, Hurrah, finally got something, I open it, it doesn't have the transaction I asked for! When I told her this, her answer was 'okay' and nothing else.

I bought tickets to an event via Ticketmaster while I was abroad, and was later contacted by Starling (not Ticketmaster) to tell me that TM had suffered a data breach, potentially including my card details. They immediately sent out a replacement.Customer service is as quick and easy as sending a message within the app. I informed them to tell them I was no longer living at the address to which they sent the replacement card and they replied very quickly explaining that I'm able to change my address myself (with my other bank account you have to phone them or walk into a branch) and gave me helpful instructions on how to do it.The app is fantastic and the card management is excellent.

I don't have bank card on the account I was switching from, although it was issued it was never activated. This meant the switch failed, so I called and messaged customer service to see what happened. It took multiple attempts to get hold of someone, the in app chat sessions kept timing out, I got cut off whilst holding for a person, and the customer service operatives couldn't access previous chats or notes, so every time I had to explain everything from scratch. I was pretty shocked at how hard it was to reach someone and how unhelpful they were. Perhaps I've been spoiled as my main bank is First Direct.I also spoke to a colleague who accidentally opened an account without providing any proof of ID, as he quit the app during the sign up process, planning to add the ID later. Starling opened the account and sent him a card anyway. Both of these events, and other reviews here, raise big red flags about how robust their core banking offering is.

They did have some teething problems with pay at pumps and some ATM’s but they all get resolved within a week or so of working with the affected supplier.

And for people who don’t like the taking a photo of yourself if you prefer to waste your fuel in going to a branch to identify yourself or aren’t prepared to embrace technology then this bank isn’t for you. The only thing that I would ask Starling to improve on is their process for disputing transactions as when I’ve asked about this before I’ve had a few niggles. If you embrace technology and don’t mind putting up with a few small inconveniences then Starling is the perfect bank for you.

They blame Natwest for that, which is not the case as my card works for all the payments I make and it is always recognised as debit card, and I have raised the issue with Natwest and re-did my card to ensure is correctly registered as a debit card.

I was considering applying for one to use abroad given the very attractive benefits when it comes to fees. However I believe I have found the flaw with the account and the reason why I would advise great caution.All the information stated here was given to me by Starling Bank this morning via Chat on their website.I wanted to know more about the security of the system and what happens when things go wrong such as an ATM eating the card, losing a card, or the card getting stolen. I was assured that this was no problem as a replacement card would be issued to my ‘UK ADDRESS’. This is not really any help to me if I am abroad so I questioned further. “It’s OK”, they said,  “As long as you spend somewhere that accepts contactless ‘Apple Pay’, you can continue using the card”. I am however travelling to places where contactless payment is rare.I then requested a second card for security, so that I had a spare, separately stored, should a problem occur. This was refused. I further requested that I open two different accounts to enable me to have two cards. This was also refused – against their policy.When it came to emergency funds they had no answer.Starling, please put me right on this should I have any facts given by your operator incorrect. Unfortunately however, if the information I was given is correct, it would seem to me that, should you have a problem abroad using this card, other than using Apple Pay – “Tough!

This rating is for customer service NOT for the banking experience per se.I actually have 2 Starling accounts, both of which were switches over from RBS as part of the Business Banking Switch programme.  The first switch went through effortlessly and to be fair so did the second.Having received my switch incentive payment for the first account within the described 7 days, I had expected the same with the second one.  Unfortunately, this is where Starling and in particular customer support, have let me down.Despite spending the best part of 2 weeks either sending messages or trying to hold a conversation with someone in support via the chat app, the latest I have is that someone will ""chase this for me"".Having tried to follow up my last communication of 2 days ago, I now feel that my messages are being ignored!If this is the experience eveyone is having then, as from the article in the Financial Times on the 3rd Nov, its is no surprise that ""RBS struggles to meet deadline to offload 120000 customers""!","Hi David,Thanks for your feedback and we're sorry to hear about the delay in paying your switching incentive. These payments are managed and paid by RBS and although we do chase up payments on behalf of customers, it's disappointing to hear you haven't received yours yet. Please do bear with us, our customer service team are on the ball and try their best for customers.Thanks,Team Starling",1057

Not sure what's happening here because support said apparently there is a ATM error and that someone would get back to me which they haven't.

The incentive was one of the reasons I switched and it seems utterly impossible to get paid. I have continuously called to ask for the correct form/email I need to fill in (over a three week period) and it still hasn't been sent. Each operator seems ill informed as to how the process works and the relevant steps. The app itself is fine and reasonably user friendly but the help and advice really isn't up to scratch. Customer Service standards really need to improve both in terms of speed and knowledge.","Hi Camilla,We're really sorry to hear about this and are keen to help.

Couldn't even give me a reason.  I can have a physical card, overdraft and anything else I want it seems, but due to some very bizarre and unknown new EU security rules I cannot add it to use on my mobile.  At least publish the reasons Starling as I cannot find anything online to suggest this at all.  Telling me to 'just use the card' is not a good enough response.Not sure if this has happened to anyone else?  I don't have any issues with the other cards in my apple wallet.

Firstly, great app and so easy to use.  I've also had great experience with customer service when needing to get my money back with a failed service.  Secondly, wow!  The business banking - compare the experience of it taking 2 months+ to set up business banking with the traditional old high street bank vs 1 day with Starling and a card arriving the next day.  And now, I find that Starling is the easiest way for me to transfer a large amount in forex to pay an invoice - gives the best rate, with all fees and costs clearly shown - even better than a dedicated currency company i contacted.  So impressed!!I wish now that Starling would offer bank accounts for teens younger than 16...","Hi Amanda,Thanks for such wonderful feedback, and for taking the time to write your review.We're so happy that everything's running smoothly and you've had a great experience with us.
