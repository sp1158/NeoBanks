There are a couple of things I would like to see though...Despite two or three times of trying, I simply cannot get the facial recognition bit to work, neither can my Wife. We have followed, precisely, their ‚Äúensure well lit‚Äù instructions, but to no avail. In order to try again, they have to delete ALL other login data types as well, which means you have to set up everything all over again - why can‚Äôt we just redo the facial bit ??Then, a minor gripe - I really do wish that they offered a fixed rate ISA account as well because it‚Äôs good to try and keep as much interest as possible outside the tax system.Overall, though, pleased I tried them out.","Thanks for your 5 star review David. It's great to hear you have found the maturity process very smooth and have liked using our app.Thank you for your feedback regarding our face ID. We work hard constantly to ensure our biometrics work as best as they can. It does however sound like in your case we may need to reset your biometrics so we can get a better initial picture. Currently biometrics are linked to a profile and is the reason we would require you to reset all your biometrics rather than just your face ID. We take your feedback on this onboard and use this directly to improve the services we offer.We are also always looking at potential products for the future and it is great to hear about the products which would interest our customers.

Why on earth should a pin take time for them to verify and the Face ID pretty duff.Finding anything in the app is difficult but for the sake of high interest, such as it is, I waited for the end of term which is tomorrow.O happy day!Anyway and mindful of filling in my tax I always file the tax certificate ready for the great event and ALL other banks provide this certificate which of course shows zero tax but gives the total interest for the year, essential for tax computation. Not so Atom who give a statement of closing the account with individual interest payments.Atom will be stuffed if JC gets in methinks when tax at source is a distinct possibility again.If Atom are prepared, like all other banks, then their back office would just roll out the certificates.Enough of all these games and I will be off!","Thank you for taking the time to leave us your review Richard, I'm sorry to hear about the issues you've had with the app and that we don't offer a Tax Certificate.  We're always looking at ways we can improve the app and our services, I'll feed this back to our app development for you. We don't produce Tax Certificates or Tax statements because all interest is paid gross, and the statements we do issue would show all your earned interest during the time you've held the account with us.

This time I received several texts advising me it was coming to an end soon. Whilst informative, they are quite matter of fact. There seems little interest in trying to keep you as a customer. It advises that you can reinvest the amount or withdraw the money. With other companies I have accounts with, they're desperate to keep your money and business, and there is encouragement to stay and special offers. I thought Atom may have a current/loyal customer 'special' rate, but alas no, just a choose a new account or withdraw your money. I find it a little strange that Atom don't seem to be fussed either way!? My last 2 savings accounts matured and were moved out, as Atom were offering below par rates, and this account has followed and I've moved this account out too. I have another 2 accounts maturing over the next few months, and with Atom offering rates similar or below other companies, these will be moved as well. I can't say that I've ever felt truly valued as an Atom customer.  Just money paid in, then text a year or 2 later when near expiry with a take it leave it. It would be nice if there was an existing customer account you were offered with a better rate. Atom are efficient, and the week period to add your initial investment is a bonus. But there is little else that endears me to Atom, and I have little affinity towards them.Update, 19/9/19 - I have now withdrawn 90% of my savings from Atom, I'm just waiting for 2 more accounts to mature and I'll close those too. Nothing has changed throughout my time with Atom. But now their rates can't save them, as they're not  top anymore and you can do better elsewhere online (as I have). Shame as it showed such promise at the start, but I think Atom have been overtaken by some very capable competitors.","Thanks for your feedback, it‚Äôs really appreciated. I‚Äôll try to answer each point but if there‚Äôs anything I miss, please let me know. Thanks for letting us know your thoughts on the texts. I‚Äôll pass your comments on to my colleagues so they can consider the wording and tone of them. I understand your comments about other banks desperate to keep your money. We never want to direct our customers to what they should do with their money so we inform them of their options and allow them to make their own mind up. For rates, we aim to offer competitive rates at the time, taking into account the fixed saver market and our rates increase or decrease from time to time. We don‚Äôt separate the rates offered to one group of customers, compared to another. Our rates only differ depending on the different terms of our fixed saver accounts.I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôve never felt truly valued as an Atom customer.

From not sending the paperwork to my new company which means I then had to pay them additional fees in interest as I could not complete in time due to their lateness, to then finally sending the redemption statement to my new company but working out the interest rate incorrectly and 'forgetting' to sent the letter advising my new company of this. I feel like they have tried every underhand trick in the book. Now the redemption is finally paid last week they have contacted me today to advise that as I cancelled my direct debit with them they can not close my account. They want me to pay them the next month's payment (even though I am no longer with them) so they can calculate costs and pay me back the difference. Surely that's what the redemption statement is for, so even though I am no longer with them I am still having to speak with them to resolve this as they have threatened me with marks on my credit file even though the account is showing as all monies paid and in credit as I have paid additional fees in interest which was their fault due to lateness.

It was a very easy smooth process, loved the app- how it kept you up to date, the rates were also great. However my circumstances in life have changed since taking out the mortgage. I'm aware that Atom don't offer a BTL mortgage which at the time of me taking it out was fine as I had no plans to rent out the property. I however have met someone and I am looking to move into his house to eventually, hopefully start a family. I applied for a consent to let from Atom but have been declined because my reasons apparently aren't strong enough. Because the flat I live in and have a mortgage for has 2 bedrooms therefore it makes no sense apparently to move out of there, we should live there and have a family rather than in my partner's house. I have had my property valued and went back to Atom to tell them that I now have at least 25% equity in it, plus I've had a rental value which more than covers my mortgage payments however they still are declining me. Sadly, I'm going to have to pay the hefty early repayment charge and remortgage with someone else. Very disappointed as I was so happy with Atom and their processes. I know a lot of people ""risk it"" and just let out their property without telling the bank, however I feel like I'm being penalised for being honest and doing the right thing!","Hi.  We‚Äôre sorry to hear you‚Äôre unhappy with the outcome of your application to let your home out.   When we provide people a mortgage on their homes it‚Äôs because they intend to live in the property, but we really do understand that everyone‚Äôs circumstances can change! We do need to consider why someone wants to let their property out, and when, but we also need to look at how affordable it might be in the long run. This means we need to weigh up whether the rent someone might be expecting would be affordable, if interest rates were to rise and the mortgage payments increased. How much mortgage the mortgage is against the value of the property is something we need to think about also.There are other factors we need to consider but I hope this helps explain some of the reasons why we might may not be able to agree an application",1343

However, the app does allow me to enter a 6-digit passcode so this isn't a major issue.My bigger issue is that, when my 1-year fixed rate saver matured the other day, a message on my phone told me that I would be able to split it, so that one part went into a new saver, the remainder to an external account. Since I have more than ¬£85000 in the account this is what I wanted to do. I guess it's there somewhere in the app but I couldn't find it. When I went to apply for a new fixed term saver it never asked me how much I wanted to put into it; it merely moved the whole lot. This isn't what I wanted. Frustrating or what. The app needs to be improved to make the process of splitting an account much easier.","Thanks for letting us know what's happened Martin. Your feedback will help us look at how we can improve the app.The facial recognition should always work so something isn't working right. If you want us to look into this for you please call us on 03333990050 at any time.The maturity options allow you to withdraw all funds, split funds or reinvest all funds, as you mentioned, if arranged before your maturity date.

I discovered Atom, their interest rate exceeded most other savings account. I read reviews as a digital app bank was new to me. All my concerns were allayed, the most important being that my money was protected by FSCS.I downloaded the app and set up my account. I found the process both easy, user friendly and I was impressed by the security. I was sent texts and emails by Atom to confirm that my account was active. I then arranged for the money to be transferred to Atom. Again Atom sent me an email and text to confirm that my money had been deposited with them. I had opted for interest to be paid monthly into another of my bank accounts and I was able to select the date I wished the interest to be paid and a confirmation of the receiving bank account.I had one query that I wished to personally speak to an adviser. I rang Atom, NO automated service, unusual in this day and age.

Whilst the interest rate was clearly stated as fixed the restriction on further deposits is hidden away on the web site (rather once you select the product you have to go to the definitions tab where it's stuck in the middle of the second paragraph).  They do also mention this on their main page if you scroll past the products, but frankly I challenge anyone to go 4-5 pages past the product they are interested in and read the rest of the web site!  Such a key aspect of the product should be clearly listed.I also asked whether they could switch me to another account which allowed future pay in as I wish to invest but that was not possible.So called them to cancel since there is a 14-day cooling off period for all online services only to be told they don't have this.  I'm pretty sure they will relent since this is a central part of the 2014 consumer contract legislation however is frustrating when organisations feel they can just ignore the law.  Default 1-star review for such organisations.Frankly at this point they could offer the best rate in the world, I won't ever use them again.Edit: In response to the Atom feedback:From the Citizens Advise Website (CAB):""14 days is the minimum cooling-off period that a seller must give you. Make sure you check the terms and conditions in case they‚Äôve given you more time to change your mind - many choose to do so.""Am confused, either the CAB is wrong or you are ignoring the law?  What am I missing?Opening an account does not seem to fit into any of the exemptions listed by the CAB.","Thanks for your review Rahim. When opening an account the app presents important information for our customers to read before they reach the account options screen. This information includes an explanation about having 7 days to deposit your funds and how money will be locked away until your fixed term ends. This information is presented before a customer can open an account following feedback from customers.Atom currently only offer fixed term saver accounts, we don't offer any alternative savings products at the moment which is why we couldn't switch you to an account like this. There isn't a 14 day cooling off period for many fixed rate saver accounts and this is the case with Atom.

Logging in is quick and easy  (when it works, which is not always!) - just open the app and blink.Negatives - Despite being an 'app based bank' it appears to operate like a legacy bank who invented an app in their spare time. It's not very user friendly, requiring a lot of taps to get to the account information. There's no list of transactions - you have to go elsewhere in the app and find a PDF statement (not an easy feat - every document they've ever created is just dumped in your 'vault'). Customer service wasn't great, and didn't seem to understand the question I was asking. If you just want to leave money there at a good rate and willing to put up with a painful app, then it's fine.","Hi Rich, Thank you for providing us this feedback. It is disappointing to see you haven't had a positive experience while using our app. We will however use this feedback directly to improve our app for the future.

I can carry passwords in my head easily and they are instantly available. So why force applicants to provide biometric data if they are not going to use it? I also didn't like the way that I had to wait 30 mins before trying to record the biometrics when it failed the first time. It would also help applicants if the supplied account number and sort code for payments included information that the account number related to the applicant...not Atom Bank. I contacted Atom's CS by Chat and it took a long time to establish that fact. The CS rep didn't appear to speak good English.","Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. When you register with Atom, we ask you to set up 3 methods of security. These are your passcode, faceID and voiceID. When you come to log into the app you can choose which method you'd like to use by tapping between the 3 circles at the bottom of the page. You will however be required to ""Step up"" security when you come to make a change such as an interest preference or giving us your maturity instructions - for example if you choose to log in with your passcode initially then you will need to step up with your faceID or voiceID. When you open an account with Atom, you will be supplied with a sort code and account number. The sort code is generic to Atom however your account number is your own, relating to that specific account. If you choose to open a new account, you'll then receive a new account number. You can find your account details by popping into the app and tapping on the bubble that displays your account.I'm sorry that you found the agent you spoke to didn't answer your query clearly, I can certainly feed this back. I hope I've helped to clear this up for you. If you do need anything else feel free to pop through on app chat or give us a call on 0333 3990050, we're here for you 24/7. :) LB",706

I was attracted by the high interest rate and although I love tech I was initially a bit wary of an App based bank (what if I lose my phone?, is my money safe?, what if there's a problem?) but decided to take the plunge. Wow. Setting up the account was simple and did not take long at all. There are three methods / options of security authentication which I really like. The interface itself is simple, modern and very intuitive. At a glance you can see the account balance, estimated interested and the maturity date. Perfect. When the app gives you an important message - for example a security message - it's accompanied by a photo of the relevant personnel and gives the whole thing a very personal ""feel"" to it.

I have no idea how these guys are allowed to be in business with just a stupid quirky app.  Stick to normal banks. This is not the future, definitely. Also my partner who is not into phones has a Samsung galaxy S3 which is not compatible with the app. If one of the partners hasn't got a compatible phone that's a deal breaker and the mortgage application cannot be completed. A total joke of a company, bank. Why not have an online portal along with the app for people who don't have compatible phones?","Hi Elias, I'm very sorry that you appear to be having such a bad time with the app.  With regards to the wi-fi, it can sometimes be that the connection is slightly too slow for the app to be able to function properly, so sometimes 4G can be the better option.  We do support most Android and Apple devices, but with the myriad of Android manufacturers out there, we can't support all the devices. As new devices become available, we have to be up to date in order to support them, as newer devices run on newer software, which can make older devices obsolete.  With us being an app-only bank, we have no plans to move to being online.  This means that we can continue to offer the rates we do.

They even returned  my critical and valuable probate documents to me without so much as a complements slip to identify who sent them (as opposed to the 11 others who included helpful and supportive information). At last when the final Grant of Approval came through it took 3weeks for the money to be transferred  (it was a week or so  with everyone else) and then only after I had chased them for their inactivity. It was with real releif I closed my father-in-laws account...and my own too.

I do appreciate that you're an 'app' based bank but that doesn't mean that you have to be like that for ever. I'm not suggesting you abandon the 'app'  access etc. but that doesn't, surely, mean that you're blind to the needs of others who would want or prefer to communicate by normal computer access. Even banks evolve.I also understand that rates alter in line with the market but there has to be an argument for rewarding existing savers to leave their savings with you. There was some marketing research undertaken a while ago into the attracting of new customers compared to retaining existing customers. The finding was that it was seven times more difficult to attract a new customer as opposed to retaining an existing one. Worth thinking about?","Thanks for your feedback Ian. We're aware we are not for everyone and I'm sorry we don't appear to be for you Ian, however, we are an app based bank and that will continue to be the way we provide our service to customers. In terms of lesser rates when an account matures, our rates are constantly reviewed in line with the market at the time.

Always try to ensure there are no background items that may distract the app from recognising your face. For example, cupboards, mirror, photos, pictures, light shades, etc. can all affect the checks the app makes when you try to login with your face. While we ask you to put your face in the lines, things outside of those lines can prevent the app from completing its check accurately. You also need to be in a well lit room or in good daylight.

"2199","David Stehens",NA,11,NA,2018-02-19,2018-03-24,TRUE,"Not as smart as they believe they are.","The interest rate is excellent, but frankly it's the only good point ( important none the less).It claims to be unique in the way it uses an app. I can't see any difference in operation to both my other internet based bank accounts that have been doing it for many years.Both present my account details in much better and presentable ways than Atom.To use a well worn phrase it's ""presentation over content"". The bubbles are just plain annoying and as a result of their design, you can't even see all your accounts on one page. And what details they do provide are incomplete.Even the user definable bubble titles are so restrictive in choice they are meaningless.The storage area that files your correspondence, provides totally unreadable titles.I can't imagine a more important web site that needs clear, accurate and easy to find detail.They need to recruit some professional designers who are perhaps old enough to have a bank account. The site looks like it was given to the local school to design.Including their new personality they have just recruited as a marketing tool, they should remind themselves they are running a bank, our money needs to be looked after by professionals.At the moment it doesn't provide full banking services, when it does unless it changes considerably I won't be moving my bank account.So.... good interest rates, covered by the FSCS so based on that alone it would be 5 stars. But as they are so keen to be judged on their new modern look, so just 3 stars.EDIT...I thought after a couple years of use I would update my thoughts.Basically nothing has improved or changed.I considered the interest rate the ONLY positive point for the app, but even that varies so much that you have to catch it on the right day.Quick tip..... If you have a bubble maturing, check the current interest level a week before. You might be lucky like I was and find a slightly higher bubble rate that is not available on maturity date. Just open it up ready, transfer the maturing funds to your proper bank then transfer those funds into the already open bubble.I use the word bubble deliberately in a disparaging way.The app remains the slowest in every way compared to all my proper banking apps and frankly any other app.The overall format remains the worst.The textual descriptions of the vaulted files remains ridiculous.Calculating your total funds remains convuluted, counting up the bubbles.Interest rate not always the best anymore.I consider it border line bad enough to abandon it and lose the small margins.If I'd been unlucky enough to experience any of the technical problems others have on here, I would run a mile.I've dropped a star on it, as it's just not improving with time.","Thanks for your detailed review David. It is feedback like yours that help shape Atom moving forward and can only help us improve. We take all our feedback on board and some of the things you mention have already been improved since you wrote this review, while others are in the process of being reviewed or improved. In particular, the storage area - the Vault - which files your correspondence, has been improved so the titles are now clearer for customers to identify.

Having opened a savings account for myself very easily a few weeks ago, my son who has just turned 18 had some savings and I suggested Atom Bank.  Today he was unable to open a savings account as he didnt have enough of a credit history and they said (via the chat line) that they couldnt verify he was who he said he was.  He is a student at school.  He has 2 bank accounts.  Is on the electoral roll.  Has lived in the same house since birth.  He has a National Insurance Number.  This is not enough for Atom Bank!?  No he has no debt.  No he has no credit card. No he has no utility bills.  This its seems is a problem!  Discrimination against the youth of today.","Hi Lisa,Thank you for taking the time to leave this review here.I understand your frustration and confusion at your son being unable to open an account, especially as you'd opened your account recently without any issues. However, with some applicants, we are unable to obtain enough information on them in order to verify them. In your sons instance, this may be due to him having a thin credit file, as advised when you chatted in to us. If this is the case, we'd be unable to offer your son an account at this time. We aren't discriminating against the youth of today, Lisa, as the reason your son isn't able to save with us isn't down to his age, rather than a lack of information needed to verify him. This can sometimes be the case regardless of age. I hope this has helped you understand the situation, but if your son would still like to save with us, he can always try again in the future should his circumstances change.Once again, thank you for taking the time to leave this feedback here.

"2735","Stuart",NA,3,NA,2017-11-17,NA,FALSE,"BEWARE - They take 5% as MINIMUM on Credit Cards and make traditional banks look like Angels","I applied for a re-mortgage with Atom Bank via a broker. The worst experience of my life. All went through fine at application, passed affordability, so a little surprised to later have it turned down on... affordability!Our mortgage broker claimed to have 3 others turned down at similar times and then had a nightmare trying to get any sense out of Atom so I went elsewhere through same broker and... it went though first time for the full amount.So to summarise my experience:Credit cards... Atom don't make it clear in my opinion that they will take 5% as a monthly minimum on ALL credit cards.When I pointed out that their calculator or policy docs didn't state this 5% fact - they said it did and even gave me a screenshot.  It does if you use simple view on their calculator...(and its hidden in a tooltip) but anybody using detailed view better watch out... because it isn't there.... they said they would put this forward for fixing... but have they after 2 months ... what do you think! I couldn't find reference to 5% minimum on credit cards anywhere in their policy docs at the time of my application and I can't today.The calculator... gave me no accurate indication whatsoever. Even after Atom had stipulated a rejection - their calculator was still stating I was good for over ¬£100k more than I had requested!!!!Underwriters.. they seem to be in a world of their own. I submitted to Atom Bank a Subject Access Request which took them the full 40 days of 40 to receive! I saw the underwriters notes and they clearly were plucking numbers out of a hat.Valuation... came in ¬£30k under... okay that can happen anywhere I suppose... but....when I applied elsewhere thier valuers agreed with what was stated.. only 6 weeks later.For a property close in value to the national average, ¬£30k is a significant difference, but Atom failed to provide this information when they had it. Should they have been transparent it would likely have put an immediate end to any further proceedings with them... but they didn't... so it proceeded via their solicitor... which leads me to...Communication. Not only did my mortgage broker struggle to get any sense out of Atom, Atom didn't appear to communicate with their solicitors. Even though they knew they weren't prepared to lend their solicitors continued to bombard me with request after request for signed and witnessed documents which were all sent off (at my time and expense) recorded delivery.. all whilst Atom knew they weren't lending. This is the most frustrating part! A complete waste of my time which Atom haven't to this day acknowleged or dealt with.I doubt Atom Bank will respond to this feedback... which in my view says it all.  If you have any credit cards whatsoever or are reliant on a chain - consider your options carefully before considering Atom for a mortgage.UPDATE 2018: Still no reply from Atom.",NA,2872

The app is better-designed than most bank apps, but that's a very low bar as most bank apps are terrible. Overall the design needs tightening up a lot: It has too many flashy animations, which distract rather than aiding the user. There's often no clear information hierarchy, and the floating bubbles, while novel, don't make it easy to figure out how to navigate where you want to go. It's a banking app not a band website, I just want to get my banking done quickly and easily, and I'd appreciate if the design wouldn't get in my way. For an example of a banking app that does this very well, see Monzo.Note: I'm a UI designer/developer and I have strong opinions about banking industry UX design.","Hi,Thanks for taking the time to leave your feedback.The positive points you've made are very much appreciated, and your suggestions of potential improvement upon the design of the App is also very important to us.We love hearing from customers with suggestions, it helps us understand what areas can be improved as we grow and develop.Thanks again.

I encountered no problems and I quickly answered the security questions without needing to check with a credit agency to ensure my answers were aligned with their data as recommended by Atom.  I then transferred the money from my current account via faster payments and money was moved almost straightaway.  Got a text from Atom confirming the receipt of funds.  This is one of the easiest applications I've made for a bank account, very happy so far!  The whole set up and transfer time took around half an hour at the most.  Feel very reassured by the FSCS guarantee.  The only thing I suggest Atom changes is the vague information on how to access funds as they seem to fudge the information here and state they're working on making it as easy as tying shoelaces without any specific details on procedures.","Hey Mina,Thanks so much for taking the time to leave a review. We're always happy to hear customers are liking the app and your feedback has put a smile on our face.When it comes to accessing your funds, as the account we offer is a fixed saver there are no withdrawals allowed before the maturity date however you'll be reminded when your account is coming up to maturity and we'll ask you to head into the app to tell us what you want us to do.

As others have reported, Atom make a big thing about their app's animated graphical interface and unconventional technology (like user verification via face and voice recognition). Unfortunately, almost every element of this design makes the experience slower and more frustrating compared to equivalent apps from the established high street banks. Getting into the app is slow - for example it only takes around 14 seconds to access to the Lloyds banking app with fingerprint ID on iPhone vs more than double that time to access the Atom app on the same device. Once you're in, I find the user interface to be confusing and slow (animated floaty bubbles rather than simple clear lists.. why?). Almost everything about the experience feels frustrating compared to a normal bank - for example, when your savings account matures, you have a window of just a few days to nominate an account using the app (I tried, but it crashed and I gave up!), after which you have to call Atom and wait in a queue, before painstakingly going through the details on the phone. On the plus side, when you do speak to the Atom call centre, they seem friendly, knowledgeable and genuinely keen to help. However, the fact that I've had to make multiple calls in one year to sort out problems on just a couple of savings accounts highlights the issues with the app.Do the good savings rates justify the hassle of using the App? Yes probably, but it just seems such a shame that Atom have been unable to invest all that development effort on things that add to the customer experience, rather than getting in the way!","Hi Andy,Many thanks for leaving this feedback.We are a new bank and always improving our app, so we appreciate your comments and this will be fed back to the design and development team.We strive to make the bank and app itself as good as it can possibly be, and we are just beginning our journey so things are still a work in progress in some aspects.

The rate was competitive and the terms of the mortgage appealed to my Wife and I so we instructed our broker to progress. Affordability was fine, documentation was provided and a decision in principal was referred to the underwriters which I am told is common practice with a new mortgage lender. Digital required much more documentation than I have ever provided to a lender before, some of which was completely unnecessary. We were assigned a legal company for the conveyancing and a valuation visit was also booked. Out of the blue I received notification from the mortgage broker asking if I could explain transactions on my bank statement which showed adhoc payments being transferred to my parents....sums of money I choose to save each month, often coming back in to the account. I gave the explanation as required and thought no more of it as these payments were well within my surplus. After a week with no news I received a call from my broker advising that Digital 'didn't like the look of the payments to my parents' and had declined our application......3 weeks into the process! I am now in a position of having to push through the remortgage with another mainstream lender (whom, may I add, instantly approved us using all the same documentation) with only 3 weeks until my fixed rate ends. My wife and I have exemplary credit records, have never missed a payment on any debt and passed the affordability check with ease. Digital offer a very appealing rate but seemingly use odd criteria to determine whether or not to lend. If there was a solid reason for our rejection other than 'we don't like the look of the payments' I could appreciate their stance however I am left baffled and almost out of time......EDIT following the Atom response and a phone call with them......This was apparently a stress test taking into account the amount I save each month - which is obviously something I can stop immediately. Conclusion - they don't seem capable of assessing affordability correctly. The stress test was attempted with interest rates reaching 5% which I'm sure you'll agree isn't going to happen anytime soon. In addition I was applying for a fixed rate!","Hi Daniel,Thank you for explaining your recent experience.

However, the thing the customer sees, ie the bank's presence to the customer is the appalling app.The app should be the priority for the roll-out (once all the financial stuff has been sorted) but it is just appalling. If you look at the App store reviews you'll see what I mean. It's like a child's plaything. People don't want silly graphics or fancy colours from a bank, they want a snappy reliable app that does the job simply and effectively. This is not what Atom have deemed to provide for their customers. It is like an art student's vanity project; all fluff and little substance. Try for instance looking at the documents that you've agreed to during signing up. They all have completely cryptic names (eg DRW34_kes298.pdf) and you have to open each one to see what's inside it. Not rocket science to give them names such as 'One year fixed rate T&Cs.pdf' is it?I have communicated at length with them since opening an account last year (despite being astonished that their app development bunch hadn't thought of the very obvious things I was bringing up) and one or two things have been changed. However, the last time I logged in I got a load of ambiguous questions about tax and residency. I don't pay tax at the moment, so to the question 'Do you pay UK tax' I correctly answered 'No'. I was then assumed by them to be a non-UK national and was asked for proof documents etc. I contacted them and pointed out the poor wording on the app, told them my tax status and was assured in an email that all my details had been amended and I wouldn't be asked about it again.Not so. I logged in a few days ago and it started to ask me about tax again. I plodded through the questions and came to 'Nationality'.The options for 'Nationality' were countries!So, the only option I had was 'United Kingdom' as my nationality, as the nearest thing to 'British' was 'Belize'...I contacted them about (a) my details not being amended some months ago when I raised it with them and (b) to express my opinion that the programmer who wrote the app giving countries as answers for 'Nationality' was an idiot. There's no other word for it. I received a bland 'Thanks for the feedback' email (no acknowledgement that they'd said they'd changed my tax status and clearly they hadn't) and that was it.As soon as my money matures it's out of there and in with a bank that can actually write a decent app for its customers.

Our broker noted it was the first time using them but the rate was worth it - we agreed and our application commenced.All financial documentation was collated and submitted and things moved along well with a valuation of the property carried out. We then waited over a month for a valuation report to be reviewed by the Underwriters. This was reviewed and we moved onto the next stage and within 24 hours we got a text....""Pop the bubbly heres your mortgage offer!"". We were elated.Whilst the valuation was being reviewed Atom had appointed Gorvins Solicitors to act on our behalf (Gorvins have been excellent) and we have been progressing the legals quickly and paid search fees. Everything was looking good.Then 24 hours after receiving our offer my broker rang me to say Atom had pulled the offer. He had no idea why and the underwriter would only communicate via email. The Atom employee merely stated to check our credit file. My wife and I still have Excellent credit scores - so this cannot be the reason.  The following day my broker was on hold for 90 minutes to get through to someone at Atom and discuss the case. This was to no avail and now they will not even respond to his emails. Our broker is a trusted family friend who has been in the business for over 30 years and has never seen behavior like this. It is cowardly and unacceptable.Despite all this, the App platform which Atom so proudly advertise still shows we have a mortgage offer and the next step is completion.As a result of all this we have had to start a new mortgage application and Bank of Ireland UK are keen to work with us. Nonetheless, there is a good chance we will lose our first ever house buy together due to the appalling conduct of Atom Bank. My wife and I along with our broker will be issuing formal complaints to the relevant parties and will be seeking remittance for the valuation and legal fees paid to date.

Seems they might be running before they learn to walk. I'm not impressed!Since writing the above I received a phone call from Atom and they talked me through the process, resulting in an account being opened. I have now opened the account - a fixed rate bond - so I won't need to do anything more for a year now. The good thing is that you are covered by FSCS so no worries. At the moment you can't get a better rate in the market.","I'm pleased to hear we got this resolved for you, Roger.

We have followed, precisely, their ‚Äúensure well lit‚Äù instructions, but to no avail. In order to try again, they have to delete ALL other login data types as well, which means you have to set up everything all over again - why can‚Äôt we just redo the facial bit ??Then, a minor gripe - I really do wish that they offered a fixed rate ISA account as well because it‚Äôs good to try and keep as much interest as possible outside the tax system.Overall, though, pleased I tried them out.","Thanks for your 5 star review David. It's great to hear you have found the maturity process very smooth and have liked using our app.Thank you for your feedback regarding our face ID. We work hard constantly to ensure our biometrics work as best as they can. It does however sound like in your case we may need to reset your biometrics so we can get a better initial picture.

Why on earth should a pin take time for them to verify and the Face ID pretty duff.Finding anything in the app is difficult but for the sake of high interest, such as it is, I waited for the end of term which is tomorrow.O happy day!Anyway and mindful of filling in my tax I always file the tax certificate ready for the great event and ALL other banks provide this certificate which of course shows zero tax but gives the total interest for the year, essential for tax computation. Not so Atom who give a statement of closing the account with individual interest payments.Atom will be stuffed if JC gets in methinks when tax at source is a distinct possibility again.If Atom are prepared, like all other banks, then their back office would just roll out the certificates.Enough of all these games and I will be off!","Thank you for taking the time to leave us your review Richard, I'm sorry to hear about the issues you've had with the app and that we don't offer a Tax Certificate.  We're always looking at ways we can improve the app and our services, I'll feed this back to our app development for you. We don't produce Tax Certificates or Tax statements because all interest is paid gross, and the statements we do issue would show all your earned interest during the time you've held the account with us.
