Now, I did get a financial reward from moving away from Monzo, but I have been considering for some time and see that now is the time. Monzo haven't released anything new recently and I don't think they are actually that much ahead anymore. Monzo Plus has been a disaster and there's no news of when that will be fixed, but the benefits you get at the big bank are generally free and that includes interest on balances.I will keep an account open at Monzo, but it will no longer be my main bank.",NA,826

Some weird transactions and refunds... and confusing information about them. The worst: don’t ever use Monzo to pay deposits for hotels or car rentals as they take it off your balance - kinda normal although not traditional - but worse is they don’t refund deposits before 30 days and if you want it earlier, you have to provide all sorts of evidence. Well, fact is with express check outs, you don’t always get an invoice... yet they seem stuck in a world when you get a final receipt for the transaction and it’s ok to block large amounts of money for such long periods of time. It’s shocking! Money must be running through Wall Street and company during 30 days so they can make up for having no currency fees. Customer service chat is full of BS.",NA,1090

It is often to late by the time we here if a company goes into administration (not that they are, there is no immediate indication that they are at risk, so safe for least next few years I hope), I just hope that it’s not too late for Monzo to stick with a direction so I can feel safe that I can trust them as a “real bank”.Service is ok but until you can convince me my account is going to be closed like so many others report I just don’t trust you.",NA,1095

Therefore, I asked Monzo (online chat), if I could block the e-cheque which hadn’t yet been presented. The girl suggested I freeze my card in the app! Pointless, as freezing a card has no bearing on a e-cheque being presented.In the second experience of Monzo staff not knowing much about banking, I contacted them about a payment which hasn’t arrives from Ireland - Bank of Ireland - by Faster Payment, and was told it could take an extra day. Later, on the website, I read that Monzo can’t accept international payments at all! Ireland is not the U.K., and so treated as an international payment.Monzo, please train your staff; give them some banking knowledge, and it will be 5* then.About the annoying part (in my opinion) - the app tells me how much money I have left for X number of days; something which is entirely inaccurate and therefore a pointless feature! How can the app possibly know what funds I have coming in / out later in the month?!Monzo, as good as your app is in general, please don’t add inaccurate & pointless features, just for the sake of adding them; its unnecessary overkill.","Hi Ian, this is great feedback - thanks a lot!

Several members of my family have been members longer than I have, it was they who recommended me to look at Monzo. I did and two hours later I was transferring funds. It’s especially good if you’re travelling abroad. Currency conversion rates are so competitive as is the deposit rates  Don’t take my word for it, have a look yourself",NA,547

I remember being a little skeptical when signing up but I don’t regret anything.  The app is nothing short of amazing, providing easy tools to manage your finances and budget each month. Contrary to other reviews, I find the chat function through the app a quick and easy way to contact Monzo who have always provided quick solutions to any of my questions and problems. No waiting on hold / answering security questions / being transferred around departments - just simple messaging. I have recently taken out a loan through Monzo who have given me an amazing rate of interest (compared to my other current account provider who I have banked with most of my life). I am genuinely impressed by the transparency of Monzo with loan interest and repayments. The app allows you to make extra payments quickly and shows you how this reduces future payments.Sending and receiving money to other people is very straight forward - EVEN if they are not a Monzo customer. You can split transactions between people easily with a couple of taps - if they have Monzo they can simply accept the payment and if they don’t they click on a link to pay you. When sending money to people without Monzo you don’t need their bank details - I just send them a secure link for a certain amount, and they have to type in their own bank details to receive the payment to that account! You can send money directly by entering the bank details, but I find this link method of sending money easier and then the responsibility of typing in the right numbers is with the person receiving the money! Another huge plus is using Monzo abroad. The last few trips I have taken I pay for everything through card payments with Monzo. As soon as you make your first payment in a foreign country they give you a message welcoming you to that country and tell you the exchange rate for purchases. The best part about this is that there are NO conversion fees, which makes spending money abroad cheaper compared to getting foreign currency or using other credit cards. On the few occasions I’ve have to withdraw foreign currency from a cash machine you get the pure currency conversion rates, which works out a better rate than buying currency before travelling. In summary - Monzo is forward thinking, makes regular innovations through updates which makes banking convenient and straight forward. You can tell that customer experience is a core value and they clearly care about their customers. I can’t think of any negatives with my own experience of Monzo and can highly recommend them to anyone who is thinking of signing up",NA,2663

You can even have a ""bills pot"" which you can pay your direct debits out of - helping with the budgeting aspect again.The customer service is second to none - the in-app chat is always responded to quickly and I find monzo's transparent way of working very refreshing.

Monzo's customer service during this period was nothing short of abysmal. From being accused of it being my fault from start to finish, to the slow and pathetic communication on their chat (only as their no phone line), to their total lack of help to help manage the situation or get my money back. In the end, they told me IT WAS MY FAULT BECAUSE I DIDNT PROTECT MY BANK DETAILS ENOUGH!!! Can you believe it. It took Skybet (the company where a lot of my money was stolen and spent with) all of 2 minutes to identify that the hacker was using my bank details from an IP address on the other side of the country, so it could not have been me - FACT! Monzo spent over 10 days doing absolutely nothing to help and even going so far as to say 'let us know if you work out it was you' spending the money. It happened at 11:30pm at night and I woke up in the morning to see over 7 transactions of my money on skybet. Plus Monzo had allowed an active card check from this faraway IP address. So in summary, Monzo's security is rubbish and their customer service is pathetic. I will never ever use them again and am telling absolutely every single person I know of the situation and plan to make it clear to anyone I can how risky it is to use them.","Hi Emma, we're very sorry to hear this happened and that you're unhappy with how we handled things.

A great modern bank","I was a HSBC for almost 30 years and I’d seen very little progress by the back in that time. The HSBC app was dull but functional and is has numerous other banking products will the bank including ISAs, savings accounts, mortgage etc. As a bit of a techy, the thought of a better bank with great budgeting features appealed to me and I opened a Monzo account (very quick and easy) and started to migrate from HSBC by transferring a relatively small amount of money each month for a few months to see how painless it would be to use Monzo for purchases. I love the transaction list, the ability to add notes and receipts and also the instant notifications. Shortly after, I transitioned some direct debits and standing orders and opened a joint account with Monzo. Again, very easy. The next step was to use the Current Account Switch Service to go full Monzo. Again, super easy and painless. I’ve not been Full Monzo for a few months and am really happy with Monzo. I love the pots and the recently introduced Salary Sorter. Aside from the great app, I highly recommend Monzo for their transparency. They have a strong community and share details of new products, issues, suggestions etc with their customers. They are also quick to admit when they get things wrong and explain what they will do to rectify things. Recent bad press about frozen accounts hasn’t deterred me from being a loyal Monzo customer. Banks have to freeze accounts when they spot potentially fraudulent activity. Monzo is no different. I suspect the chance that my account would be frozen is 0% so I really have nothing to worry about.",NA,1608

I went abroad and hired a car and I had to provide 800EUR deposit. The money was deducted from my account and it made my account overdrawn and I had to use the overdraft facility I had arranged with Monzo. When I returned the car back to car hire company I was advised that the deposit had been returned. However my balance did not change and I was still overdrawn. Once I have received the confirmation from Budget car hire that the deposit money has been returned I did contact Monzo customer service. I have been passed on from person to person. I have had to repeat myself over and over again. It is extremely worrying as so many people have been looking into my personal data stored on Monzo app. Monzo did finally respond that the money did not leave my account and it was only pre authorised transaction. The strange thing was, my app kept showing that my balance during the two week car hire was overdrawn in minus and yet Monzo's statement they sent me showed the account was in credit( plus). Also, on the day when the car hire Budget took the deposit it showed that I was charged for one day car hire which was not correct as I paid for the cost when I booked my flights and it was a special offer for both the flights and car hire. I have given Monzo the car hire statement showing clearly that there was no such charge on that day. Monzo chose to ignore the statement and to ignore such charge ( I don't know where did that charge come from?). Monzo has now changed the way we see our balance and we can't see what was the balance for the previous day.My account is still overdrawn as it would have been approx £700 which should have been returned back and it seems the money has disappeared. Monzo transferred £30 for the bad customer service experience however I am still questioning where is £670 and why there was a charge in August. Just to compare the experience. I have hired another car abroad recently, I had to pay deposit of £230 by using my main high street bank card. Once the car was returned back, the account balance did increase with my high street bank meaning the money was returned even if it was a pre authorised transaction.I think if more people would raise their concerns with FCA regarding Monzo's conduct then it would definitely help to regulate such banks.","Hi Alena, sorry to hear you've had a bad experience here.

The app has lots of modern innovative features. I like the fact that i can quickly check my balance and know that it is is up to date. I like also that it gives a breakdown of where I am spending my money, for example how much I am spending on groceries, transport, entertainment etc. It tells me how much I have left before payday (I’ve set it for the dates I get paid) and how many days that amount has to last. I like the fact I can separate my money out into different pots which I don’t want to spend right now, and choose to have only the amount I want to spend for the month showing as available to spend, as well as still being able to see the overall balance. It is also fun to use and explore all the features. This is also good to have as a second account to budget spending money for the month and great for travelling abroad as there are no charges for paying by card abroad. It’s also great as you can choose to see who in your contacts has a Monzo account and easy to invite friends to join.

Since then, I've used it every week, and even gone 'full monzo' recently. Making it my full bank account.The kinds of features that made me love Monzo in the early days are still great. Push notifications about spending and balance. Nice little reporting features and easy ways to split money with friends.For a place you're just keeping a bit of money, this is all OK. But switching to 'full monzo' was a big, big mistake. Overall, I just don't think they're ready to handle the kinds of serious problems you might face with a real bank. This comes down to their customer service. Overall, I'd say the quality of customer service is very poor, and agents don't have the training to know when something is serious.During my current account switch, Monzo messed it up. Essentially, I lost about £650. Nobody in the customer service team was able to help me, and kept blaming everyone else. My previous bank, my credit card provider, etc. In the end I had to go to the current account switch service and raise a formal complaint. Finally I got a response from someone in Monzo who was able to help me.I've basically had the same experience whenever something serious has happened with my bank account. I can't imagine contacting a more established bank, e.g. Barclays about losing money and getting back a response of 'oh no, sad face emoji'.Overall, I'd say get a Monzo account. Put some money into it, use it for your day to day spending. But do not, under any circumstances, switch your full current account to them. When something goes wrong, it will be incredibly stressful. And no number of emoji messages will make you feel better when it's your money at stake.","Hi Christiaan, we're sorry to hear you had a bad experience.

We had mobile banking apps for our previous joint account but we're now more aware of how and when we're spending. Probably a result of the alerts when either of us spend and the budgeting and reporting functionality, rather than each mentally tallying our spending and reconciling periodically.- Better Budgeting 💰 — Pots with goals have been excellent at ring fencing our savings and our budgets. We took this approach to budgeting anyway but via other tools, Monzo does it directly in the app. Looking forward to further improvements to this over time (see below).- Speedy Support 💬 — when we've had issues, support were generally responsive and helpful (it's taken longer occasionally in recent months but most interactions have been very swift)Two things we'd love to see which would make our family budgeting/spending better:- Joint account parity 🤝 - there are a few places where joint accounts lag behind personal ones. For example, people can't split bills with our joint account. We can transfer money over to personal accounts to pay for things but that feels a bit clunky.- Custom Categories 🐱 - we have categories of spending not covered by Monzo's defaults and this makes budgeting hard. We have to repurpose categories and remember what they mean, or temporarily assign one for ""holiday"" for a month in order to report on our spending the way we want. Being able to add categories, or even just subcategories e.g. ""Pets"" or ""Holidays"" or ""Medical Expenses"" and not having to roll them all into ""Household"", would be ace.",NA,1788

From filling out the application to the account being approved and opened was literally 10 minuets. I had a notification 4 minuets later saying I had been verified and approved. I was supplied with an account number and sort code there and then and given instant access to app. They also added a virtual card to my Apple pay wallet so I was able to transfer funds and pay for things straight away without even receiving the card yet. I’ve already loaded funds and used it in shops and it works like a dream. also opened a savings pot to save up for things.

I feel engaged with my money and the way everything is presented makes my outgoings seem more simpler, and as a consequence I feel in control of my money. I have struggled with finances for a long time so the fact the Monzo app does this for me is kinda life changing. I have finally been able to save money and I couldn’t be more happier. I have decided to make Monzo my main account, and even became a Monzo Plus customer. BUT... :) To be honest the Monzo Plus benefits are kinda... meh. Tidal discount...? C’mon! Other banks offer better ‘Plus’ account benefits. They really need to sort this and soon (please)! There are no cash back offers as well which really disappoint me, I left Santander who in fact had great benefits on their 123 account. Which I’m a tad salty about. Also I’m seeing a lot of accounts being frozen, and people being left without money for a long time. Not gonna lie, it makes me a little nervous to be with Monzo in case it happens to me! I don’t know the full story of these cases but there just seems to be a lot of problems whenever I read reviews. I just think as a customer you have to feel confidence in the product, and I don’t fully feel that right now. I will stick with them (for now) but obviously I want MORE from Plus or other similar options, and I hope it time I’ll feel more confident (unless it happens to me 😂)","Hi James, thanks for the feedback! We're still working on making Plus the best it can be so thanks for sharing. And freezing accounts is something all banks have to do sometimes, but we don't close accounts without a good reason.

I decided that if the app didn't work, and the chat wasn't answered, this probably wasn't the app-based bank I was hoping for, so I asked for them to delete the data they already had about me as I was no longer interested in opening an account with them. 40 minutes later from my initial query, I got a reply! I was advised they were sorry I was concerned about this, but ""unfortunately, we can't delete this data, even if you haven't finished signing up, because we don't have the technical ability yet.

They stated ""I can assure you and reassure that the information is being stored safely and we have not intention of using it"" (spelling mistakes and all...). On the 06/09, they sent me an email advising me to ensure I had the latest version of the Monzo app so I could keep using ""my"" Monzo account. Which I don't have as I never completed signing up.

Monzo decided it would be ok for them to uust freeze my account and close it with no explanation and no warning. All the money I had for 1 week was in that monzo account. The children were hungry I had no money to buy them lunch. I messaged monzo via chat to us on the app to recieve the same automated messages telling me how there is nothing they can do and how a specialist is looking into it. They had litrally NO reason to shut down my account I had direct debits linked to this account. I explained to monzo I have children its the school holidays and I have no money. They then suggested. Wait for it.........They suggested I contact a local food bank.Are they taking the mick?Like is this company for real?I have money to feed my children sitting in my monzo account. They have just decided I cant withdraw what is mine insted they suggest I contact a food bank. Im sure food banks wont be happy with everybody sent to them because of monzo. There is people who genuinely need food banks. Anyway Ive came to a realisation with monzo. What I have noticed is that people with a significant amount of money in the bank seem to be waiting up to 12 months to receive they're money back. Yet people with smaller amounts seem to have their money refunded within days. It seems as if Monzo are keeping peoples money hostage so they can make money off the interest. This is robbery and this should be illegal. Hundreds of people are leaving reviews saying the exact same thing. Something is not right. Stay away from monzo let this company go bust they leave familys unable to eat and theyve prevented people from going on holiday. Avoid them. They are thieves. They then logged me out of the app and closed down my whole account so I was unable to chat to them. When trying to call the number is gets hung up straight away. This company is run by robots. The BBC rip off Britain are also investigating this sham company. They need bringing down with immediate effect.","Hello Vicky, we're afraid that we can't give any more information about why we closed your account here on Trustpilot.

Additionally, after the first unlawful transaction they ""froze"" my account (which I agreed to) but somehow a week later another unrecognised transaction from a vendor in Peru came in and I went into ""unauthorized overdraft"" for a transaction I didn't recognise, and an overdraft I didn't ask for or authorised.

I tried to open my father an account and he went through the verification process, waiting 48 hours as advised within the app but nothing happened. A week after initially trying to open it I got in contact with Monzo on his behalf to be told it was still waiting to be verified. Another week later (2 weeks after initially applying) we had to get in touch again to be told Monzo could not offer my father an account with no reason given. Communication has been sorely lacking and Monzo failed to get in touch letting him know he had been declined. How can this be for a simple bank account with no overdraft facility??There were no emails and the app still shows an awaiting verification message. Before this happened I encouraged a fair few friends to open an account, and sang their praises. However if anyone asks me about a Monzo account now I shall tell them that the company is not as good as I thought, the communication terrible and to take their money elsewhere.For over 2 years me and my siblings have been using our Monzo cards regularly, preferring it over our more traditional bank cards.

I must say ivr found them great until now and was soon to switch my main account over to them. I work with banks every day and could only wish that the big fish were as far ahead with their software as Monzo are. A big advantage is that they offer great rates when spending money abroad. However, we recently visited Argentina and have been left short changed by around £75 which has left a bitter taste. Some cash machines in Argentina charge astronomical prices for taking cash out (around £8-9 per transaction). This is not Monzo; it's the Argentine banks. After declining an £8 charge at two separate ATMs whilst trying to take out £30, i later noticed that two lots of £38 were taken.  This was almost 1 month ago.Very disappointed to have to post on here but i feel compelled to warn others. This same thing happened to another member of our travelling party at a 3rd bank in Buenos Aires. That's 3 separate transactions with ATMs from 3 different well known global banks, where no money was dispensed, where Monzo are the common denominator. In fairness, they have referred this back to Mastercard, which takes 8 weeks, so I'm hopeful that they will see that the cash was not dispensed and be able to trace it back to my transaction. I am, though, disappointed to be without my money for 3 months. I appreciate the need to substantiate claims but I'm almost certain that, had this happened with my other main bank, I'd already have the money.","Hi Daryl, we're sorry this happened.

The app is easy to use and is very helpful when managing money and expenses. The chat support is 24/7 and responses are quick and helpful. However there are some features missing for example your are currently unable to scan in cheques like you can with many other banks. There is a distinct lack of choice in savings ‘pots’ as they are called ISAs have their positives but lots of negative for example you need to leave a minimum balance of £500 to keep the pot open it makes you feel you don’t actually have that money saved an available. It also takes one working to transfer money from your ISAs to your main current account and does not work over weekends which can be a bit annoying if you need a large sum of money instantly.

You will need to keep a proper bank account with the likes of Halifax, Natwest etc.Why?Monzo debit cards aren't accepted by lots of retailers for various reasons (ASDA (You can't get Cashback), CostCo (You can't use to buy fuel), and there are many others) Monzo will blame the merchant and the merchant will blame Monzo, you the customer are left in the middle.Customer service is non-existent, you can't get through on the phone, the in app chat doesn't allow you to download a copy for your own records. Email responses are non existent.It seems the staff haven't come from a banking background, and you get the impression very quickly that the staff don't really have any understanding of the regulatory framework in which they are operating.Having made a formal complaint I got a response which was just the bare bones of the base template, no other information regarding my complaint at all. Monzo were happy to send that as their final response. Imagine employing staff that don't even read the response they are going to send you. That matter has been referred to the Financial Ombudsman,The app itself is pretty good, most of the time. You will need a modern phone as you can't install the app otherwise.Maybe in 3 or 4 years, having matured, and having got some experienced banking staff onboard, Monzo might be more than a novelty banking app.You'll also need to read the small print, your data is pretty much fair game for any purpose they see fit to use to monitise you.","Hi there, we're sorry to hear you've had a bad experience here. Most places should take Monzo cards (thanks to Mastercard acceptance rules), so please let us know about anywhere specific that you've had problems and we'll investigate.

In Sept 2018 I tried to withdraw from an ATM machine and it didn’t dispense my money yet it appeared on my Monzo App that it did withdraw. I used my App and called the customer service line to report the fault and got refunded immediately pending an investigation. I got told the investigation might last approximately 10 weeks. Due to the wording of the correspondence and the phone call conversation I thought it was best not for me to touch the money in my account and wait for the investigation to finish. After unsuccessfully chasing up Monzo for an update, I got notified that the matter settled in Dec 2018 (yet I got told in May 2019 after chasing them up and writing to them). Due to the long time of me not feeling confident of using my account until I hear the outcome of the investigation and the numerous times I have tried to chase it up no avail. I got offered £80 as a gesture of goodwill. I accepted the goodwill and proceeded to use my account as normal after getting confirmation that their is no issue with my card. I attempted to use my card at an ATM and this time it didn’t dispense the money nor did it leave my balance. I thought it was the ATM after fearing the worst that history repeated itself. I proceeded to use another ATM machine and the same thing happened, then I thought to try my other bank card and see if it’s a fault. The money dispensed when I used my other bank card. I became frustrated and contacted Monzo the lady on the phone was proper nice and understanding and offered to send me a new card out. I then asked the fact that I got guaranteed by a senior member of staff that the issue last September was with the Atm and not the card. The customer service lady stated that she will raise that issue and sent me a message in the App. I then received a message on the app by a other member of staff, stating that I used a bad atm and that has nothing to do with my monzo card. I have replied with a screenshot of my other account that I successfully used after my monzo card declined. I then requested for further information as to why my Monzo card didn’t dispense then, because I got worried maybe my card was cloned or tampered with. I received a reply by another member of staff saying that’s our bottom line and if I have an issue to take it up with the financial ombudsman. I’m awaiting a response now from the ombudsman. I have never been so disrespected and I didn’t even need a lot just a replacement of my card and an explanation.

I’m aware that others might have good experiences with this company but my experience has been different. Within a day they allowed a direct debit to go through my account despite me previously cancelling it via the app. I had to call to query this and request the amount be refunded (I subsequently have had to call them twice to chase). They froze my card and told me they’d reactivated it - that still didn’t work and I had to chase them on this too. Despite many messages on the app, no one replies. You then call and are told they need to complete correspondence on the app, only for them not to respond again and so the cycle continues.  I’ve raised a complaint about the ongoing situation with them and asked for my account to be closed. For a bank, I felt that within a day they’d proven themselves to be unreliable, unresponsive and seemingly indifferent to the fact that they have a duty of care to customers. I’m not sure why I was swayed by a company with a big budget who spend lots on customer acquisition and then fall short on care.In the whole 15 yrs I’ve been with first direct I’ve never had anything like this happen and so the lesson for me is that the grass isn’t always greener and I’ve withdrawn my money and reverted back to a bank I can trust. I really had no cause to leave anyway bar the lure of gimmicky features and functions.I also don’t feel the app security is great - the app doesn’t lock or have face recognition functionality and when you call, they ask very basic questions which I don’t feel are secure enough to avoid identify theft.

Even if you have an urgent issue (eg. a fraudulent transaction).I have twice had to spend, literally, days on very slow-motion ""chats"".  It's not a ""chat"" by any normal understanding of that word:  it's a messaging service where they usually take hours and hours to reply to any message.The staff change during the conversation and they don't always read the previous messages, so you have to repeat yourself, which they then also take hours to respond to, which drag out the queries to ridiculous lengths for the simplest things.  And the staff are sometimes sloppy with their words, or they provide incorrect information, so there is confusion and, again, it takes hours to correct a simple miscommunication.Add that together and it can take days to get the simplest thing done.For example, it took me 52 hours (> 2days) to get my transfer limit increased.  In that time 5 different operators were on the ""chat"" and they sent me 12 messages.  That's an average of >4 hours between each message. Another request for response marked ""urgent"" (a suspected fraudulent transaction) took many hours for anyone to respond to, followed by a string of people taking-over from each other to whom I had to repeat the background (even though it was all written-down in the messaging conversation), each of which took hours.  Like a slow-motion car crash.A non-urgent request can take 11 hours for a response.There is no other way to get support.  Staff say things like ""mark this conversation as urgent"" which is impossible to do after the chat has started.  They lack even this sort of basic system facility to provide a better service.And their chat is filled with faux familiarities and emojis as if it were some sort of casual social media.  It's a total fail, because they address you by your formal name (which I never ever use except for formal things like a bank account where they demand - including Monzo - that you use your formal name) which rams home that these are total strangers who know nothing about you while putting on a pretence to be a friend.And after you've been waiting hours all you want is communications precision and action, not constant apologies, casual lies about being ""unusually busy"" (they are always busy) and emojies.When you want a serious issue dealt with (eg. suspected fraud) this is exactly the opposite sort of response you need.Monzo clearly don't care about support.

What other bank would message you telling you there is a technical problem with payments from certain businesses even if it didn’t directly effect you. I have twice had unauthorised activity on my card which I knew of virtually instantly as Monzo notifies you as soon as there is any movement on your account. One a simple error from a Spanish bus company withdrawing over £200 from my account at 1am I contacted Monzo and had the funds back in my account within 30 minutes and a form sent to me electronically to fill in. I never heard about it again Monzo dealt with it from there. Second time was partially my fault I signed to a free trial of an online account without reading the very very very small print and had £60 taken I contacted Monzo explained that their online form was ridiculously misleading they refunded the money and said I should email the company explaining that I do not want their service and they will deal with it from there, as far as I’m aware they did no money removed again and heard nothing more. With regards to the App it’s so easy to use and counterintuitive you’d be hard pushed to struggle using it it’s so easy to see your spending trends in fact sometimes to easy as so when you over spend and it’s a depressing drop in your money graph it’s as sad thing to see especially with a hang over. The instant notification of what you spend especially with contactless being used so much more is superb as I’ve twice caught staff trying to over charge wether accidentally or not as my screen flashed with amount spent from Monzo before the PDQ had printed the shops receipt so I called them out on it instantly, another £40 odd pounds saved. If you’ve got this far down my waffling review firstly well done but you need to get out more and secondly a constant complaint I see popping up about Monzo on here and other sites, that is the freezing or closing of accounts. Most complaints mention money was paid in from somewhere and a lot of the time large amounts from abroad then the account was frozen. Lots of people complaining but if the moneys paid in are considered suspect Monzo legally HAVE to freeze the account by law they also legally cannot tell you why. So all the slating of the bank is irrelevant they have no choice. Let me just finish by saying no I don’t work for Monzo but they have made my banking so much easier and secure I felt the need to write the worlds longest review. Give them a go, they aren’t perfect nothing in the world is but they are the way foreword with banking.",NA,2858

The position of freezing my account did make me unable to feed my children , but as your notes say on your site I’m not a criminal as you’ve listed as a sob story. I find it increasingly hard to justify why one minute I’m on chat saying I’m expecting payment (child benefit) then when it lands up pops the box saying we’ve decided to shut your account. And freeze the only money I have. I won’t be fobbed off after reading on the community pages that I’ve a funny name or I live in another current as I don’t like to stereotype but your customer services and all your values are wrong . In the last 6 weeks on trust pilot alone there’s over 70 cases of freezing accounts and yet all the customer service advisors and I quote state “ must of done something fraudulent “. Now, I can assure you that I have never been involved with or associated with anything fraudulent in my life. We get the same standard message “ specialist this , specialist that”. In all my years in banking I thought I’d ditch Barclays and give you a go , but , it’s seems that your quite happy to freeze accounts when you want, bank the interest for weeks and send the same standard response letters week after week. You block a recognised phone number on your call centre of an account is frozen also, very strange that. With the amount of complaints going to the ombudsman and the FCA it’s only a matter of time before your hauled up and slapped with a heavy fine. I just hope all the people that you have left genuinely stranded get some redress and not mocked by your “  criminals use I can’t feed my kids, I’m ill in poor health “ comment. What an absolute nonsense you should be ashamed of yourselves. Don’t bother replying or trying to say “ we shut accounts for a reason we can’t discuss it on here” because we all know you pick and choose. Stay away from this company - if your looking for someone do your research join starling or revolut. But not these. You’ll be ok for a month maybe two, but then the brown stuff will hit the fan in a blink of an eye and you’ll be on your own. If I could give a minus that would be too good. But hey ho annual reports lost 32m in the year , guess they need to recoup there money somehow.","Hi Varun, thanks for letting us know about this - sorry for any inconvenience it caused with your application.

My bank has always been just a place you keep money in and I thought my bank was good until I tried Monzo. Now nationwide feels like it’s archaic. Monzo is literally the best thing I’ve ever done - I’m much better with money already and it’s been about 6 weeks. The speed in which you can get help, calls answered and now I’ve worked out there’s a messenger on the app to speak to someone! It’s so fast and any issues I’ve had have been sorted so quickly. Just to show the difference: when I signed up it was because we wanted a joint account. I was going to put husband on my account so I called nationwide to find out more. In the time I was on hold, I had looked online at 3 different accounts, chosen Monzo, applied for the account, called them from my mobile (as I had realised I applied in my new married name but my ID was in my maiden name), spoke to someone, emailed a picture of my marriage certificate, waited on the phone while they received the email, they updated it, confirmed my account, made a drink and sat down- and THEN nationwide answered. My normal bank said they would send information. Well by the time I got that letter - it was just an application form - no info and both me and my husband had a Monzo account each - and a joint account and had been using it for a week or more. The day I opened my Monzo - my husband opened one that night and we applied for a joint account - 2 days later our cards arrived. I cannot tell you how amazing this experience is. The account gives you everything you never realised you needed. The staff are amazingly helpful and for the first time I feel like I am actually on top of things. I always know what is in the account and the notifications if one of us spends really helps us too. Just amazing truly genius.",NA,1861

I transferred a sum of money to their account without first checking the destinstion bank. Had I have done more research into this bank, I would have seen that it’s the choice of bank for online fraudsters where criminals all over the world can setup, buy and trade monzo accounts to defraud innocent people. This is because monzo is a online only bank that can be setup from anywhere.Whilst I accept it’s my due dilligence to check the recipients credentials, monzo bank could have but did not help reverse the transaction. They have not even informed me whether they have closed the fraudsters account or not.I advise anyone transferring money to think twice if the sortcode is that of monzo bank. They do not do their due dilligence in checking their customers credentials and are thus complicit in their fraudalent schemes. Monzo accounts are traded on the black market where International students setup accounts and sell them to criminals to defraud innocent victims.

Couple days before end of there deadline she got a message stating they have made a business decision to close her account no reason what so ever.. They asked her for other bank details to have the remaining balance of £276 transferred to another account. She gave them details and was told it take upto 5working days to complete and fully close the account.She can no longer log onto her account so assuming they have closed the account. It's been 14working days since this and still no money has arrived nor is she getting any response on email no more..

Most banks try to deliberately trip you up and squeeze as much money as they can from you, whether it be overdraft fees, transaction costs and so forth. Monzo really feels to me that excessive profit isn't their foremost and highest priority, they actually don't want you to get in loads of debt and seem to, well, care.

They refuse to give any answer whatsoever and despite freezing my account they have managed to charge my account for unplanned overdraft fees. How do you charge a frozen account? I have been told lies by staff. I was first told no-ones got back to me because it's the weekend and there's a skeleton staff, then was told that they don't know how long it will take to investigate but someone will get back to me soon. All they do is lie! It's unacceptable. I have a pending eviction from the property I rent and ability to make payments for bills has gone so I'm in arrears with almost everything.

All of them told me about the reward for us both and encouraged me to sign up after showing me how good the app looked. I started to sign up but forgot about the links my friends had sent me. Through the process of signing up I was never reminded about the reward scheme for signing up so I went on with it. Half way through I remembered they had all sent me links and chatted to someone online who told me I wasn’t able to receive the reward unless I signed up with a different email. I thought my friends were entitled to their money as I wouldn’t have even thought about it otherwise. Later on I found out because I had got past a certain point signing up it wasn’t possible at all to receive anything. I deleted my account after as I thought this was unfair intending to resign with my other email only to find out after I closed the account they cannot delete your information so you can not resign up unless you get a new phone number! Apparently it could take years for them to reach a point where they can delete information.. ridiculous when it’s such a big company! To add to that as I complained on Facebook chat, they then mentioned they could put my details in a beyond use part of company where my information doesn’t get shared with anyone else. Is this even a question? Of course I don’t want my info with other people and I should’ve been asked this before I closed the account! What a massive waste of time",NA,1491

However my partner has and it has been big issues. When my partner first had his card details stolen in 2018 the service provided was impeccable. The card was frozen and an hour later the money had been refunded and a new card was being sent. My partner was unfortunate to have his details stolen again in January 2019 (the thief had bought £100 worth of plane tickets with his details) the same brilliant service was provided by Monzo, all resolved very quickly with the money refunded. However, a few months later and Monzo have stated that British Airways will not cover the claim and Monzo has looked at the evidence given by British Airways and Monzo won't fight it further. My partner has to refund £90 back to the account and if he can't afford to pay - then it goes as an overdraft until paid. Very frustrating when he didn't make those transactions in the first place and when the other transactions that took place (which were also flights) were approved but it just happens the British Airways one isn't? To make matters more infuriating (and suspicious) - those fraudulent transactions have been wiped from his Monzo account statement so we can't even screenshot it with the location as evidence! It seems like a scam, it's like Monzo is turning on it's customers who lost out on money but because Monzo can't get the money back from those fraudulent transactions it's using the victims and overdrafts to make a profit. My partner has had accounts for many years with ""normal"" banks and he has not had any security issues at all. After this I would only recommend to only use Monzo to use it abroad like a kind of cash card without the fees or just transfer into it a very small amount of money that you know you will use. Please don't transfer your wages into it or your savings!! It's security is horrendous and when the notification on your phone appears stating money has gone out of your account, (in this case) - it's too late to get it back!",NA,2061

Most retailers in China only accept Wechat or Alipay as a cashless payment method and you can only link up a bank card issued in a Chinese bank. This forced me to have to withdraw cash (which is set at a limit of £200 for 30 days fee free) and incur charges after the £200 limit was passed. To Monzo's credit (wahey) they were very responsive and supportive in helping me to find a solution and they eventually credited my account with £20 which covered the 3% withdrawal fee for the rest of my trip. Japan was different in that cash is still very widely used and card payments are not. Even in central Tokyo some restuarants only accepted cash. My advice would be to get a good exchange on a wod of cash before you leave your home country if you plan on going to China or Japan. Use Monzo when you can, don't rely on it to pay for the majority of your goods or services. The other issue we found is that the Monzo card itself is very unreliable. My partner's card (also a Monzo account holder) wouldn't work in any ATM's which meant that I had withdraw cash for her as well. Monzo's best offer was to send a new card in the post to Japan! Also, on some occasions my card was declined in some stores were as my partners worked?!? Very unreliable.To be fair to Monzo the app based support system works very well and they will respond pretty fast. The app itself is very nice and the split the bill feature is great. They still have a lot to improve and I would suggest you seek other services in addition to Monzo.","Hi Richard, thanks for your review.

However, I recently withdrew money from my paypal account to my Monzo account and the account was immediately frozen. There’s no obvious reason as this isn’t a suspicious transaction and I have provided Monzo with the screenshots to show I withdrew the money etc, still I only get generic responses saying a ‘specialist’ will look into it. I asked how long this may take and was told they don’t know and that if I need to pay bills I’d just need to lend off people and if I need to eat, to visit a food bank. I can’t believe a bank can operate with such slow security checks, even though I’m not sure why it’s required at all on that transaction. The customer service is dreadful as I said above so don’t expect any help if this happens to you.*After receiving the reply below, it is even more clear that I’m correct about the customer service. There is absolutely no reason why a genuine PayPal transaction means an account should be frozen. They didn’t even read my review as I actually stated my account was frozen, not closed. And to say they do everything they can to make sure you’re not in a bad situation is a lie. They can’t even respond to the live chat and when they do, they say they’re not willing to chase it up with the specialists. All lies.","Hello, we're afraid that we can't give any more information about why we closed your account here on Trustpilot.

However when I actually needed their support they are terrible. The short version is that I booked a car hire, and immediately cancelled it several days before the hire day collection. As per the car booking process I needed to send an email before the collection time for free cancellation. Any how they cancelled it, and acknowledged my email a few days later. However they accidentally charged my yesterday for the car hire (£85.00). They have told me I will get it back but may need to wait up to 14 days. I spoke with Monzo several times and was asked to send in screen shots which I did, however they say before they can release the money they need me to get an email from the car hire company saying they don't want my money, otherwise it will stay as deducted. The challenge I have is I have already been told I had to wait 14 days just for a call back, and the charge was not authorised by me so why should I even have to go through this process. I expect a bank to support me, not the 3rd party, and Monzo have been absolutely no help at all. Whilst it is only £85.00 it is the principle, I should not have been charged in the 1st place, and Monzo should have supported me which they absolutely did not. just about to move all bank away from Monzo as I do not trust their support.

That extra ‘friction’ won’t really stop people from dipping into the pot. Just wanted to suggest in the future perhaps setting a level of stringency as to how difficult users want to make it to access their money.","Hi Nick, that's right - we recently changed how lockable Pots work so that you can unlock them yourself. We know a lot of people liked the extra friction of having to ask us for it, but it wasn't a great experience for customers (having to wait on us) or for us in terms of the extra demand.

I can only presume this means my account has been closed - received no confirmation. How can I get help with my account issue now? I have rung the customer service line for 2 days running and the automated response always cuts me off.

You can’t even make a complaint to anyone! Where the app live chat is not available (as in my case) then provide other means for customers to get in touch which work efficiently and where you can get through to someone in a reasonable time whether that be via email/another app/phone.

I've used the card all over Europe and a couple of the popular holiday resorts in the U.S, all without problems.I can't comment on the efficiency of Customer Services because I've never has reason to call them, but they are the first to admit if things begin to slip and respond accordingly.It's also fair to say that that a lot of the in-app ideas from Monzo are being copied by the old fashioned Banks.

It would be nice for the support to have a priority option on the request (yes they have the urgent flag), but sometimes its nice to ask a not so important question that you don't mind waiting for a response for a few days or so (so low, medium, high type thing), asking a not so important question and getting a response in an hour or so makes me feel bad, as anyone with an urgent request may be waiting to be responded too.Monzo's built a great community around the bank, loads of threads / topics being discussed everyday and even the developer channel on Slack has grown so much theres always something going on, when you have a community building side projects, helping with designs and coming up with great ideas, thats when you know you have a valuable business.Really looking forward to the new business bank accounts that Monzo are now developing with the latest fund round.Keep up that amazing work!",NA,1565

I had my account frozen over Christmas and new year. I had my maternity money in the account along with some money from my dad and other bits and bobs. All frozen. All direct debits we’re being bounced and I was very stressed to say the least. I obviously messaged Monzo and made a formalComplaint using their process. “I’d like to file a formal complaint please” via chat. It was very simple. I had initially contacted the Financial Ombudsman but I had to wait for my complaint to be dealt with first before they would take it up. I also contacted Your Money online magazine which writes about the banking industry and helps customers reclaim money back etc etc. I was desperate after all and had nothing to lose! My account was initially unlocked 8th January. Phew 😅. Which I was over the moon about - obviously. They stated that my complaint was still being looked into and this would have an outcome by the 19th January. I waited. Then yesterday 17/1/19 I received a chat response from Kimberley in complaints to say myComplaint was being upheld (they achnowledge it’s a valid complaint) on the basis that my account was locked for longer than they deemed acceptable and that I was given little to no useful information, coupled with repetitive - non human responses. I was given £500 compensation and some lovely flowers and gifts for my new baby! I simply can not believe it. I was expecting a “whilst we understand this time must have been stressful for you - we have to adhere to regulations... blah blah..” but I didn’t. I got an actual response from a human which went above and beyond anything I’d ever expect from a bank. Thank you so much for trying extremely hard to restore my faith in Monzo.

(Enamoured by a bank, what?)Monzo makes banking simple and efficient. From the ability to instantly freeze or unfreeze your card in the app, to instant notifications for transactions. It makes money management a doddle.The budgeting tools, such as the summary page in the app make it quick and easy to figure out where all of your money is going and where you should probably cut back a little.Pots also aid my budgeting a lot, especially with their scheduled deposit/withdrawal. My bill management is now automated within my bank account. All of the money required for my bills gets locked away in specific pots on pay day so that I can't spend it. Then the money is automatically deposited back into the main bank balance on the days that my bills are paid. This has been a God send for me, someone who is extremely impulsive and struggles to stop myself using money that is needed for something already.The customer support is by far the best I have ever experienced anywhere, let alone from a bank. Chats with the support agents are casual, but professional and efficient. Most issues need to be handled through the in-app text chat, which may not be the ideal method of communication for some, but it's great for me since I suffer from horrid anxiety with phone calls.Mid to late 2018 Monzo did have some issues with under-recruiting support staff and at that time chat requests were sometimes taking days to receive a response. However, Monzo quickly responded by massively scaling up their recruitment program to get it under control. Once support requests were back under control, they explained what went wrong, what they had learned and what they would do to improve. This is a perfect example of the level of transparency that Monzo maintains.But aside from that blip in Monzo's forecasting, the longest I have waited for a response from support on the in-app chat is about 20-30 minutes and issues are often resolved in under 10 minutes after receiving the first response.",NA,2069

Money has been used in shops to buy things and to send to my partner as some bills come out of his account instead of mine. Like mortgage etc. I’ve set up numerous direct debits on the account and have been using it as my main account. The account was Frozen Christmas Eve?!? No message sent to me to say they were investigating the account and when I went to use my card it was declined. Thinking I’d entered the wrong pin I messaged monzo on chat (the only way you seem to get a response and their preference for you contacting them.) only for the lady to state she couldn’t see a problem and the card was active with no flags. Thinking it was my error I tried again 26th December. Declined! I then contacted them again and they said the issue was with their “specialist team” and it could take a few days for someone to get back me. I’ve read numerous online blogs and articles about how Monzo flag suspicious transactions or how they lock accounts for fraud etc. However I haven’t done anything that they speak of in these articles. At least I don’t believe I have. I’ve looked and looked and then looked again over my transactions and I can’t see anything which may have been cause for concern. I’ve just used it as I did any other account ive ever had. It’s really frustrating. I have over two thousand pounds in my monzo account which is my only money. Money which I’ve put aside in a savings pot so I wouldn’t touch it so freely. I’m not flush. The money which has been deposited in there has come from UK registered companies or private individuals (eg. My partner or direct family) for my maternity allowance, also money for bills etc and I had £800 sent to me from my dad for a pram. With the reference; Pram. Unlike one of their articles in the guardian where Monzo’s ‘financial crime’ head of department states fraudsters make up lies to apply pressure on their staff to unlock the account - I am genuinely pregnant and this is genuinely my only account which I’m using currently. (Who needs more than one current account at a time actively running. I only have so many DD’s.) My monzo account is my main account ( which they can see by the amount of direct debits I have set up) and this is genuinely causing me untold stress and aggregation. The bills which are overdue are now stacking up and although this can be rectified - in the short term it is stressful. Especially when I’ve worked so hard to make my payments on time and to try and improve my credit file rating. Such is life. I was with Natwest for 16years and never had an issue with them. Never had a payment frozen. Never had my account so much as aquire a coldIn all those years and I’ve been with Monzo for two months to track where I’m spending my money (I have a baby on the way I’m 35weeks pregnant so it’s helpful to see what I’m spending on the most) and they freeze my account. And they Don’t tell me why. Which in itself makes me think they’ve put me into a category which isn’t favourable!  I’ve asked for them to close the account and transfer the funds as soon as possible to another account so I can at least carry on with my daily life and pay bills etc. They’ve said once I get a response from their team I can talk to them about closing the account. The suspense and waiting is killing me. I admire this bank fir many reasons. I’ve read online about how they really are pioneering the way forward for the smart banking age. However as I find myself caught up on what would appear to be the wrong side of whatever it is they’ve frozen my account for (I’m jumping to conclusions- however from what I’ve read online I can’t think of any other reason why they’d freeze my account - unless they thought there was something they needed to check) I can say that sometimes too much technology may work against us. The customer. IMO Bank with a high street bank They’re far more secure and far better equipped to manage your account ethically and most importantly ‘within the guidelines’ and parameters of the law. HSB’s also have telephone lines so when you haven’t heard anything for days you can call and speak to someone.

I can’t even close the account because you can’t speak to any of the Monzo Morons.They sent me an email for another round of investment funding. Maximum available was £2k. Then they said because I hadn’t opened an account with them earlier I couldn’t invest. A day later Debit card arrives. No PIN number arrives. I try to move the £2k back to the account where it came from, but you have to enter a PIN with the debit card. So, you go through the rigmarole of “revealing pin” and then it just constantly gives you an error message. Not one of the Monzo Morons gives a damn about sorting out the simplest of transactions to put back into my original account. I reiterate you can’t speak to anyone, no one answers the help number - it just cuts off, any emails they don’t respond to, No-one ever replies on the app chat.

I will be contacting the FCA well in advance of that and I will looking at calling the Police in to look at options given you are effectively illegally holding and therefore stealing my £2k! I feel certain I am not an isolated case and as such the FCA should really be looking at suspending Monzo’s banking license. Surely, this must be against banking regulations; if not I will be requesting it is. Also, when I did manage to get through on one call there was a huge amount of background noise from other Monzo Moron agents, so much so I could hear virtually everything.

I'm at a point now where I feel fully in control of my personal finances, in a way that my high street bank could never have provided. I can see all of my predicted outgoings such as upcoming bills and regular payments, offset against my salary. This allows me to easily calculate how much is left to spend and create budgets accordingly for my daily spending.Simply by being more aware of where my money was going, I have been able to accumulate savings (not an easy feat as a young person living in London) and these too can be organised in a simple customisable ""pots"" for particular goals. The Monzo community forum is also a knowledgable hub for financial discussion, as well as a place to give feedback and suggestions for new features. Due to the transparent nature of Monzo's staff and their presence on the forum, you will actually see your suggestions being taken on board and integrated into future releases if the demand is substantial enough.To sum it up, Monzo has made me more engaged and proactive in my personal finances than I ever expected to become.

I was not rude when I raised the dispute.According to their T&S, they'll give you 30 days or if you break the following t&c's, they'll close it immediately:- broken the terms of this agreementI have never done this, I use Monzo as my full bank, have done since current accounts were launched so no idea how I would've all of a sudden broke the terms after using it fine for those months.- put us in a position where we might break the lawI work in a barristers office, why would I do this?

They don't offer any interest on savings, so you're essentially lending them your money for no return...2. They don't plan on offering the interest themselves, they're doing it via a third party and said they're not passing the risk, but they essentially are? What about if the third party company goes bust while Monzo doesn't? You lose your money and Monzo loses nothing.You're better off looking at N26 or Starling Bank.

"4129","TK",NA,7,NA,2018-10-03,NA,FALSE,"I regret I trusted Monzo... I cannot access my own money, and they keep deleting my text message, nobody is helping.","A MONZO staff froze my card by panicking with the incorrect detail on the transaction that I pointed out in my account. I didn't ask her to freeze the card. I only asked a question to make sure it's safe, she did it before checking anything without telling me during the text chat. But then MONZO started wasting my time for days, completely ignoring what I say(text) and keep on asking me to do a very weird thing to check identity.  I didn't ask to freeze the card or lost card or claimed any problem at all, why should I deal with their own panicking situation... So, I ordered the new card, but then now, they blocked my Pin for no reason!  Now  I am not able to access my own money. There is something extremely wrong about MONZO: The main problem is this:1: They freeze the card by panicking by themselves while the customer is not asking. (I guess they do not have the confidence to cover the transaction wrongly done) 2: They only have one Identification method that exactly the same method as the criminal/scammers do. They ask you to send them your selfie and copy of your ID through the text chat. This is precisely the method what Identity theft uses. They say ""We use a very high-security system so no problem"" ... the scammer uses the same phrases. How can I trust them only by the text chat? > I was a victim of identity theft years ago -it was awful, the scammer actually did what MONZO is asking to the customer. They have zero flexibility to use another identification method such as other normal bank or credit company does - code, secret questions, address date of birth etc. - if the pin doesn't work they will send you via post- Monzo does none of that but eager to use scammers method. 3: They eager to keep on chatting by text, taking ages to get back to the customer or none. Responses are incredibly unhelpful no other alternatives; they don't listen or understand the customer's situation (they 100% reply with the text ""I understand, but unfortunately.."") they keep texting back same things over and over again, there is no humanity there. 4: They freeze the account for no reason and keeping the money. (Was I scammed??) - Seems to happen to quite many people. 5: They ONLY have a mobile app to see your own money, and if account blocked or lose the phone or the app bagged, then you cannot see it. If that happened, HOW TO ""CHAT"" TO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE?  No internet access, no phone call, no legitimate information of where they are or who they are! 6: They keep deleting my text message, while nothing has been sorted. /// The scariest fact is//// The staff who froze my card has now disappeared from the chat record!- So, what would have happened if I sent my selfie and ID to that person who disappeared from the record now??  It is horrifying! At least I am glad I didn't trust that person at that time! They don't even have ""a case number"" so how to make sure and keep the evidence of where that ID sent! /// The most awful fact is/// I cannot access my own money, and now I LOST LOTS OF MONEY for Monzo and wasted my time for 5days.

Wasted significant amounts of time in online chat with people who say the account looks fine and they will escalate it.  Even manually transferring funds to my previous bank account failed, errors with no further updates whatsoever. This all began when their version of 3D secure (requiring you to log in to your phone and authorise every online transaction you make) began to fail and disrupt normal transactions. There is no way around this flow, and means you need to have a fully charged phone and signal/wifi to buy anything online. Out for the night with friends and order some food in the following morning? Not without battery left in your phone you wont!! In itself it's a terrible idea when it works, but utterly financially devastating when it fails and you have no way to buy or transfer anything from the app. The latest instance was the lasts straw, I had no food in the house and no method of payment to buy any, and no update whatsoever as to when it will be fixed. Just ended up going to bed without any dinner and hope it's fixed tomorrow or I'm going to have to go begging to neighbours for a fiver at 6am so I can get the bus to work. I also have an overdue bill I can't pay, so may well have no internet shortly. It's an extremely disastrous financial situation to be in having transferred all money into the account earlier in the day to pay the bills, and then can't use any of it. I have my mobile bill due soon, so am extremely concerned I will end up with no internet and no mobile data to use the app at all. Then what?Shockingly poor ""customer service"". Unlike bigger banks there are no customer helplines, only long and frustrating online chats which span hours due to the amount of time it takes for the chat agents to reply (we're talking 30 minutes to hours between replies).There is no copy/paste functionality in the chat, so a real pain in the backside to even get the message across, much less waiting for their replies and endless ""referring to a specialist"" which simply doesn't happen. Eventually you are forced to start a new chat with whatever random agent joins and you have to sit there typing everything out again on a mobile virtual keyboard with outrageously detailed history of every failed payment, times, dates, who they were to, money going in, money going out, transfers, everything, and of course you can't actually see your accounts or copy/paste anything in, and you have to click through several menus to go in and out of chats and payment histories, so you're either in and out of the chat to type everything out, or you have to physically write out your own bank statement on paper just so you can type it in to the chat. I've never known incompetence and bad design like it.  I ended up taking screen grabs of statements, and payments, as well as photographs of my computer screen showing error messages and sending those to the chat agents.  Why arn't these chat agents able to see what's been going on in the payments history themselves?! It's ludicrous. No follow-ups, essentially stealing your money by negligence and making fools of their customers. They are unfit to be offering current account services at this stage due to the level of financial difficulty they are putting customers in regularly. I have provided a full report to the FSA and in the process of a complaint with the Ombudsman. I can see from other reviews that this is far from an isolated incident, it's having a real and serious effect on people's basic finances due to negligence, bad design, buggy software and little or no recourse. When any big bank has disruption for just a few hours it's headline news, but because these smaller alternatives aren't ruining the lives of the masses they get away with it.  This kind of caviller approach to disrupting people's lives will not be tolerated. If they don't nip it in the bud now it will undoubtedly be their undoing. Those experiencing similar issues should immediately approach the Financial Ombudsman, make a complaint to the FSA, and also sending a copy of the complaint to Monzo, 38 Finsbury Square, London EC2A 1PX. If they fail to deal with these issues fairly and in a timely manner, they will be stripped of their FSA licence and no longer able to terrorise customer's lives by placing them in financial peril through no fault of their own.",NA,4519

I took £50 out the cash machine and transferred £20 to a member of family. Was then proceeding to buying a few items in JD Sports to be told my card was declined. To my suprise i was shocked as i had alot of money in my monzo account. So i then went onto the chat and spoke to them regarding this where i was told my account looks fine so my withdrawal limits must have set of a freeze trigger and this was to be escalated to another member of team, here i was then told that this may be a bug and they will get it fixed but for me to receive a reply would be within 7 days. I was outraged by this. Then we are now just over 14 days into this ""bug"" and im still being told they have no update? How is this possible my account was working fine and the operators told me they cant see no blocks or anything. So i have now asked for a manager to call me as the number i found for them just keeps getting cut off. When i asked for a manager to call me they stated they dont do outgoing calls? so putting 2 and 2 together with all the things im seeing regarding reviews and the information im given by the company im getting nowhere so i'm now going to have to take this further and see where i go from here.","Hey Aaron, we’re sorry to hear you’re having trouble here.

I'ts really changed my life around and managed to get me out of debt I have been in for years.Sign up processThe sign up process is easy and simple - feels the same as signing up to Facebook (which is how it should be in todays modern world). I entered my information and confirmed my identity and the card was said to be on its way at 11am on Friday. By midday on Saturday it had arrived and looked beautiful in the Hot Coral. It always turns heads and brings comments when I spend on it which is nice.Day to day useThe best and by far most useful feature is the instant notifications. A friend recently had her bank card stolen, and the thief had spent using contactless in a number of places. Stupidly she didn't cancel the card as she expected it to turn up and it wasn't until three days later that the transactions appeared and she realised somebody had been using it. Monzo on the other hand allows for instant notifications, even with contactless. Before the receipt has been printed, my phone has told me the purchase was made, where and how much. Had I lost or misplaced my card, all I need to do is jump into the app and freeze it so it cannot be used. If I find it again, I can unfreeze it.Customer supportI've spent hours waiting on hold trying to get through to my old bank to ask them a simple question, having to argue with an automated system for ten mins before being placed on hold. Monzo's live in app chat feature is effortless. You can send a message and close the app, and get a notification once they have responded (usually within minutes). Available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for any and all queries.Best feautureBy far the best feature is the transparency of the bank. Their blog posts explain exactly what they are working on, where they are financially and where they plan to go next. They are the only bank (that I know of) to release their quarterly accounts. They are the only bank (that I know if) that ask what features the users would like to add, and what services we would like. It really is shaped by the communityI really can't understand why highstreet banks are so far behind on this and make everything so difficult. Monzo is effortless and 'just works'",NA,2213

Monzo are committed to total transparency, and they really stand by this. They publish all their intended new features, listen to their community and appear to actually take on board feedback, which is unlike any other bank I've come across. I've also been to offices to meet the folks responsible for making things happen behind the scenes - they were just as helpful in person.The app is slick and nicely laid out. Forecasting is useful, payments are (in my opinion) the best among all current mobile banks. The ability to send money quickly to contacts or even people near you is second to none. The interface has remarkably few bugs and the real-time notifications for payments are friendly and useful.Now for the bad stuff. New features and cutting-edge tech are great, but they are far from the central focus of a bank. The central focus of a bank is to be aware of how much money you have and where it is at any one time. Unfortunately, during the time I've been banking with Monzo, they've failed to set up direct debit instructions, got my balance wrong, failed card payments on multiple occasions and failed to action things which have been agreed (and even marked as completed!) by their support staff. This is worrying. Admittedly, the card payment failures have largely resulted in friction from moving from an external to an internal processing system, but it's still not what you expect from a bank.In summary, Monzo are pushing into the future. They're going about things the right way, but they're not quite there yet. For everyday transactions and small payments you can't go far wrong, but I won't be trusting them with anything more serious just yet.","Hi Will, thanks for your review!

However, as of today, I'm finding the overdraft facility confusing. I had my overdraft removed because of 'new information from Noddle' about a default that I've got. I defaulted on an account in 2014 and paid it off quickly afterwards via a debt collection agency, yet this is affecting my account with Monzo now?

Not like legacy banks where your transactions show up 2 days later, purchases show up like 2 seconds later. Also, there's something quite nice about waking up on my payday and seeing the notification on my phone of the money coming in.- Not having to worry about your card being blocked when you're abroad. They know from your phones location that you're abroad and then charge you the Mastercard rate so you always get a good deal.- Budgeting tools. I can see at a glance what I'm spending on eating out or bills. Impossible with my old without exporting a spreadsheet and taking ages to manually tag transactions.- Excellent support. They are always available and usually respond in a few mins through the chat. Plus, all my previous chats are available, so if I have a problem (like I had a few months ago adding my phone for Google Pay) then I can continue the existing chat without having to explain everything again to the bank.Personally I don't quite get some of the negative comments on here. The bank is regulated like a Barclays or HSBC so they clearly don't ""steal your money"" like some people allege or would have been shut down by the FCA or whoever it is a long time ago.I gradually started using them more and more over time and I'd suggest someone interested in trying it does the same. Just get a card, transfer a tenner or something and use it. If you like it then transfer more and use it for spending. If you prefer it then you can always do a current account switch from your old bank (or just do what is called a partial switch and keep the old account in for paying in coins or cheques). Yes, it's a little weird having to show your passport up to your phone camera to get verified but as a regulated bank they have to do the same kind of checks that a high street bank would do so.

Waiting times for legacy banks were more than a month. I tried many apps, and despite the waiting list, I got my Monzo account quickly (2 days), and the card was almost immediately in my mail box.It works great. Send money, receive money, through bank transfer (from friends whom I gave cash), Apple Pay and through cards. No charges either. Monese charges a 0.35% to top up by EEA card, and 2.5% for cards outside. Monzo hasn’t but received a single cent from me, and I got the account, card and can top up. What’s more, it seems they are building a genuinely good community. The only thing I can see a competitor having over Monzo is supporting non-EEA cards (e.g. from Serbia). They’ll charge you more, but you have the option. Or holding different currencies. What compelled me to write the review was today I had a problem with some vending machines. They charged my card but didn’t give me anything. I thought, hey, let’s give it a shot and test this ‘fraud prevention’. To say a vending machine is committing fraud is kind of a stretch, but I went with it. I explained the issue to them, and an hour later BAM, money refunded. ‘Mai’ helped me out. I had no proof I didn’t get anything from the vending machine. Then I had an issue again (hey, I was hungry and nothing’s open Sunday (Monday?) at 2AM. Told them, and got my money back.

I heard you need hours to reply, and if you don’t reply back soon you just have to start the process again. I was told I’d have to wait approximately 2 minutes to be connected to a live agent. I waited from 11PM until 6AM!!Once I did get an agent, it was very straightforward and I got my account back. But damn if I didn’t wait long. Revolut got £72 from me. Monzo got £0.

My only minor feedback is that I wish I could set my own money month - I don't get paid on the 1st of each month, so the overview of spending is never quite right.

The fact that you can freeze your card if you lose it (but unfreeze if you find it again) change your pin and set up GPS based proximity (can only use the card if your phone is in the vicinity of it) are great peace of mind features also. The new current account features introduced are really appealing as well, making and receiving payments is very simple.

I like technology and equally as a bank auditor have an interest in new developments in the industry so have looked to this account and [albeit slightly sad] have spent a while reading around fintech offerings and it is a very interesting time and proposition.  To me the Monzo system is a little like a hybrid between the building society model where members opinions matter and then also mixed with technological advancements.  Technically at this stage, when see past the app and the budgeting benefits the offering has the big banks can offer more. However, the big banks now progress at a glacial speed and to a degree could be argued are a little complacent.  These new institutions are evolving beasts and being part of something from the early days and seeing where it goes with its continued progression offers something that you will not get with the major banks.  The account was set up very quickly and the card arrived in good time. I do not have a chq book or see any option for one - but most people like myself have probably had the same chq book for the last decade or longer.Have had the account for about six weeks now and using as my main account and has operated very smoothly and quite like the instant notifications when I use the debit card as this provides comfort as I will know instantly if any transactions occur that are not mine. I travel a lot with work and also appreciate the fact that I will not have to pay excessive transaction fees every time I use my debit card.

'Logging in' is as simple as opening the app - which means you're regularly on top of your money - so rather than going through the rigmarole of logging in to your online banking only to see an out of date balance, it's there, at the touch of a button in your hand.Cannot recommend highly enough.",NA,950
"4250","Arol Lang",NA,1,NA,2018-04-04,2018-04-04,FALSE,"Monzo Community","This is a review of Monzo Community, not Monzo as a bank. I feel it is justified to give an opinion about their Community without making any references to the banking with Monzo as it is a part of the overall Monzo experience.  First, the positives: Users are encouraged to join in and express their views or even vote on certain matters such as ATM charges which is great and gives you the feeling that for the first time in the history of banking you can actively participate and influence their development trajectory. Also, if you face some technical issues with your account or card, you can generally expect prompt help from other community members or Monzo staff. To the negatives:In recent months, the Monzo Community has become rather unfriendly place. Any attempt to address your concerns with the direction of Monzo business is usually interpreted as containing criticism of the bank and ends in unpleasant attacks and scorning from the core group of 10 to 15 long term community members. To give you an example, initial suggestions of responding to Trustpilot reviews by Monzo staff was interpreted as an unnecessary waste of resources that could be used on designing new features, Trutpilot was presented as an unreliable site where reviews are mainly fake and so on. This has been finally addressed by Monzo as they have recently announced they would take more proactive role in addressing negative reviews here. This is a great move and it has to be acknowledged which I am happy to do. What bothers me is the way some contentious topics are handled on the forum. Quite often any unfavourable opinions about Monzo’s lack of progress in moving their product forward or criticism of their practices culminates in closing the topic which pushes it down the list and eventually those concerns might not be addressed at all. The most controversial one, such as the discussion about Monzo’s CEO Tom Blomfied’s salary, where users asked for it to be revealed, seems to have got deleted! Really Monzo?The role of leaders has to be addressed as well. Some of them come across arrogant and condescending in their replies to other users. I am aware that they are not Monzo employees but let’s not fool ourselves, they shape the company’s image as well. It is time for Monzo managers responsible for this part of business to act and either employ full-time Ops who could manage actions of the community in a professional manner or nominate Leaders who understand the complexity involved in online communication. For Leaders to justify some of their replies, as 'I believe it’s fine to show my personality on the forum', is simply unacceptable.Monzo wants to be a new, friendly and ethical face of banking. They are largely succeeding at it at present. But they also need to be ruthless in areas where their reputation might suffer irreversible damage to that image. Their Community is one of them. As of now, it feels like a cliquey club intended on forcing out any unwanted opinions and trapped in an echo chamber. Monzo, it is time to act.",NA,3044

I ended up signing up through an iPhone instead.After that I had good experience of using the prepay system. I liked the way it all worked and gave a good view of my spending, good view of what was spent and where (including the mapping showing locations and better names than the usual bank cryptic names)Was impressed enough such that I signed up for the beta bank account, where it all started going wrong. The new card arrived, but the app didn't like it for some reason - giving a very generic ""something went wrong try later"" message. Suffice to say trying later didn't work, but it's a beta right. Emailed support, no response, emailed again after a week, no response, after a month, no response. Cut the card up at that point.Now, many months later, they are stopping the prepay and keep emailing me telling me I should have my new card and contact them if not - they normally respond in 10 minutes was the claim on one.

I have since used the card all over the world, and it proved particularly useful when travelling between countries (France, Austria and Croatia) where different currencies are needed - but with the Monzo card, this was absolutely no problem at all. However, a couple of small, pop-up shops in Amsterdam would only take Maestro cards - and so I would recommend carrying some cash with you. But majority of places have no issue at all - just use the card as you normally would use one.I am so glad to see the well deserved success from the recent upgrade of Monzo from its original beta phase. The customer service is amazing; they are not only very quick to respond, but very helpful and understanding, resolving any issues with such ease and without a problem, always trying to sort a solution to fit your needs.

I was a bit nervous about using this on our holiday in Spain because it is so new and there have been a few teething problems but the rates and the simplicity of this card were so tempting that I decided to give it a go. I installed the app and although a bit reluctant to do the initial £100 required in order to receive the card, I bit the bullet and ordered it.

I was later informed by technical support that Superdrug and a few other shops don't accept contactless from Monzo but using my pin was fine and the transaction was completed quickly. The card worked every time in Mallorca, both contactless and chip and pin. I absolutely love how you get an instant notification of your transaction, together with remaining balance. This is in fact easier than a bank card for which you would need a cash point unless you are using an app. Very easy to top up too and I love the app. It was very clear how much we'd spent and what we had left and you can top up anything from £10 upwards with a debit card. Rates were good and I also love the fact that you can spend what you've got left in the UK without any charges or penalties for not using it (had a nightmare closing a post office card last year and getting my remaining balance back, had to phone them up, etc and it was a right pain).

If you have an odd amount left in credit it is eay enough to add the appropriate amount to round it up to the nearest multiple of £10, by faster payment from your bank account, although it does take a bank working day to appear.You can't top up odd amounts to reach a £10 multiple from the linked card unfortunately.

I travel a lot on business and it's nice not to to have to pay any fees, unlike most other cards which rip you off on forex.  Recently spent a week in the States without ever having to use cash.  The only downside is that you can't use the card for Uber, but to be fair that applies to all pre-pays and there is nothing Monzo can do about it.  Superb customer service.  The card is a bit garish - once seen, never forgotten!  Now that I have this I have almost entirely stopped using cash or credit cards as it is a great way to keep track of spending.EDITA year on from my original review, I have downgraded my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars for a few reasons, specifically: 1) Overseas cash withdrawals are no longer free; 2) over the past 12 months the card has been declined on numerous occasions even though it always had a sufficient balance; 3) it is no longer possible to top up the account using a mobile; 4) the Monzo forum ""community"" contains a number of ""over-enthusiast"" posters who become downright rude and obnoxious in response to any criticism of Monzo, giving the forum at times a toxic feel, and any thread that is in any way negative or even neutral is rapidly shut down by the mods; 5) customer service now typically takes several hours to respond to a query; and 6) the roll-out of overdrafts seems to have been handled in a rather ham-fisted way.Forum consists of obnoxious posters most of whom have invested in the bank",NA,1559
